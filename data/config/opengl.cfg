Video.OpenGL.Caps.Stencil = yes

; Enable if OpenGL seems to crash for you. It is possible that this is
; caused by not correctly clipping geometry to screen boundaries.
;Video.OpenGL.Caps.NeedScreenClipping = yes

; Set to the number of OpenGL clipping planes that are hardware accelerated.
; If set to 0 then this kind of clipping is disabled. Default is 6.
Video.OpenGL.Caps.HWPlanes = 6

; Clipping modes:
;    n (no clipping): don't use clipping at all but rely on z-buffer
;      to do the clipping for us. Only works when the object is rendered
;      using either ztest or zuse.
;    z (zbuf clipping): this is a variant of 'no clipping' specifically
;      for the outer polygon (or view). In this case the outside of that
;      portal (i.e. the places on the window/screen where CS will never
;      render) will be filled with z-buffer.
;    s (stencil clipping): use the stencil buffer for clipping.
;    p (plane clipping): use OpenGL plane clipping.
;    0 (software clipping): use the software clipper.
; All of these modes (except software clipping) have an uppercase variant
; which adds lazy clipping before doing the other operation. Lazy clipping
; means that a quick test on all triangles will discard all triangles that
; are totally invisible but keep all the others without clipping.
;
; Below are clipping modes for various operations. In addition to the
; modes described above you can also use 'auto' which will try to
; autodetect the most efficient operation. You can also use multiple
; modes in which case these modes will be used in case the first one
; is not possible for some reason. One example is that 'n' cannot be
; used on objects that are rendered with zfill or znone. In that case
; you need other modes. If you don't specify other modes then 0 will
; automatically be used (software clipping).

; Clipping mode to use for portals with optional clipping (i.e. most
; regular portals). Possible values are n,N,s,S,p,P, or 0. Usually 'n'
; or 'N' is recommended. 'n' is better if you are on fast hardware that
; doesn't mind overdraw. 'N' is better if you have hardware for which
; overdraw is relatively expensive.

; This tells how to blend lightmaps with their underlying textures.
; Legal modes are 'multiplydouble', 'multiply' (the default), 'coloradd',
; 'add', and 'auto'. Choose to fit your hardware and taste.  The 'multiply' mode
; is supported on most hardware but is often too dark.  If your hardware
; supports it, 'multiplydouble' often gives a better scene.

; Enable an artifical speed limit on the FPS. This can help to increase
; smoothness with very high frame rates. The value given is in ms.
;Video.OpenGL.FpsLimit = 40

; If this option is enabled, the OpenGL renderer will use an extra
; flag to further brighten textures. This is especially useful in
; combination with LightmapMode=multiply as this simulates the
; desired 2*SRC*DST mode on cards that don't directly support
; 2*SRC*DST (i.e. multiplydouble). Of course this slows down
; the renderer (until we use multi-texturing).
