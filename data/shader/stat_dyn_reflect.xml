      Shader for "masked reflections".
      
      Goal: Allow specification of, in addition to a diffuse texture, a 
        reflection texture and a mask texture. On white parts of the mask,
        only the diffuse texture should appear, on black parts, only the
        reflection, on gray parts they should be mixed accordingly. 
        
      This leads to the following formula for an unlit pixel:
          Cf = Cd * Cm + Cr * (1 - Cm)
      where: 
          Cf = final pixel
          Cd = diffuse texel
          Cm = mask texel
          Cr = reflection texel
        
      To have the texture lit (via "software lighting"), the right side is 
      multiplied with Cl * 2 where Cl is the light color (either from a
      lightmap or vertex lighting). The multiplication with 2 is done to 
      allow a higher range of color, a surface can appear twice as bright
      as its diffuse color.
      
      The new formula is:
          Cf = (Cd * Cm + Cr * (1 - Cm)) * Cl * 2
      This has to be mapped to a multitexturing setup. The whole thing is
      split up into multiple passes:
        1. the Cd * Cm part is drawn
            -> Cf1 = Cd * Cm
        2. the Cr * (1 - Cm) is additively drawn on top of that
            -> Cf2 = Cf1 + (Cr * (1 - Cm)) = Cd * Cm + (Cr * (1 - Cm))
        3. the lighting is applied, ie the framebuffer pixels are multiplied
           with Cl * 2
            -> Cf = Cf2 * Cl * 2 = Cd * Cm + (Cr * (1 - Cm)) * Cl * 2
      ...and we got our desired shading.
      
      Optimization: Actually, the 3rd pass above is only done for lightmaps; 
      when vertex lighting is used, we don't need a texture for that, but can 
      multiply the light value into the diffuse resp. reflection texture in the 
      first TU on each pass. Basically, we render:
          Cd * Cl * 2 * Cm + Cr * Cl * 2 * (1 - Cm)
      which is equivalent to the original formula.
      
      Note that because we have to add (Cd * Cm) and (Cr * (1 - Cm)) we can't
      make a single-pass shader with multitexturing only (MT can only do stuff
      like ((a*b) + c) * d, but not (a*b)+(c*d), which is what we need.)
      
      A further possible optimizations would be to put the mask into the alpha
      channel of the diffuse texture; this would allow to do the blending
      between the diffuse and reflection texture on one TU, and further this
      shader could be rendered single pass when 3 TUs are available.
      
      Currently, the shader needs only 2 TUs, hence runs on all but the most
      pitiful and/or old hardware.
      
      For simplicity reasons, the shader requires the definition of a mask
      texture (shadervar "tex mask") and a reflection texture 
      ("tex reflection").

           Also compare the mixmode of pass 3. A mixmode specifies how to
           actually apply the "final pixel color" to the framebuffer.

           Notice that in the first pass the mixmode was omitted; the default
           is "use the Zmode that was set in the _renderstep_". We just assume
           the default "zmesh" (use the Zmode that was set on the mesh) was
           specified. If something else was set, this shader may produce 
           incorrect results.
           
           Ergo, sometimes renderloop and shader have to be tuned against
           each other. Don't worry, tho; usually you don't have to mind
           that much. If you're unsure what <zmode> to use in a pass, try if
