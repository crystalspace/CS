StartMe.0.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the default castle map. This map uses
StartMe.0.desc.1 = parallax mapping but will fallback to bumpmapping if your card
StartMe.0.desc.2 = doesn't support parallax.

StartMe.2.desc.0 = Crystal Space is a real 3D engine. However with some tweaking you
StartMe.2.desc.1 = can force it into emulating something that resembles isometric
StartMe.2.desc.2 = a bit. This example also uses stencil shadows.

StartMe.4.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the parallaxtest map. It shows parallax
StartMe.4.desc.1 = mapping in Crystal Space. You need pretty good hardware to see
StartMe.4.desc.2 = the effects. If you don't have the needed hardware support you will
StartMe.4.desc.3 = see nothing special.

StartMe.6.name   = partsys
StartMe.6.exec   = walktest
StartMe.6.args   = -silent partsys -mode=800x600
StartMe.6.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the partsys map. It is a very simple demo

StartMe.7.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the terrain map. It demonstrates the landscape
StartMe.7.desc.1 = engine in Crystal Space. There are two versions of this map. This one
StartMe.7.desc.2 = is 'terrain' which looks nice but needs good hardware to run nicely.
StartMe.7.desc.3 = 'terrainf' is a lot faster.

StartMe.8.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the terrainf map. It demonstrates the
StartMe.8.desc.1 = landscape engine in Crystal Space. There are two versions of this
StartMe.8.desc.2 = map. This one is 'terrainf' which is usually faster then 'terrain'
StartMe.8.desc.3 = and doesn't require advanced 3D hardware. 'terrainf' also
StartMe.8.desc.4 = demonstrates the foliage generator (which slows it down again).
