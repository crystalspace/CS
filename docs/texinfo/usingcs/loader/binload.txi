Crystal Space supports various @sc{xml} loading plugins. One of those plugins
is the binary @sc{xml} plugin which encodes @sc{xml} in a binary format that
is faster to load (but not necesarily smaller).

@subsubheading Converting to and from Binary Format

Using the @samp{docconv} utility you can convert between various document
formats. To convert a document to binary you can use:

@example
docconv -outds=binary filename
@end example

@samp{filename} is either a @sc{vfs} path to a single file or else the
name of a @sc{zip} archive. In that case the @file{world} file out of that
archive will be converted.

To convert a document from binary to ascii @sc{xml} you can use:

@example
docconv -outds=tinyxml filename
@end example

@subsubheading Making Crystal Space Support Binary

Just add the following lines to your application configuration file:

@example
System.Plugins.iDocumentSystem = crystalspace.documentsystem.multiplexer
System.Plugins.iDocumentSystem.1 = crystalspace.documentsystem.xmlread
System.Plugins.iDocumentSystem.2 = crystalspace.documentsystem.binary
@end example

The first line means that the document system multiplexer is used when
a document is read. This multiplexer makes sure that the correct reader
for a format is used. The second line instructs the multiplexer to try
to parse all documents with the XML reader first. (The xmlread plugin
parses an XML file faster than the tinyxml plugin, however, only the
latter one supports creation and modification of XML files - which usually
isn't needed for map files and alike.)

@subsubheading If you Parse Documents Manually

If you read CS documents @emph{manually} somewhere in your app, you should
use the following snippet to obtain a document system object:

@example
csRef<iDocumentSystem> docsys = CS_QUERY_REGISTRY (object_reg,
	iDocumentSystem)));
if (xml == 0)
  docsys.AttachNew (new csTinyDocumentSystem ());
@end example

This uses the document system specified in you app config, but if none was
specified falls back to the TinyXML system.
