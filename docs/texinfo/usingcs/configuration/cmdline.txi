All Crystal Space applications respond to a common set of command line
options.  Many applications define additional options which are specific
to that particular application.

The most immediately useful command line option which all applications
respond to is @samp{-help}.  This command list all of the other options to
which an application responds.

The default setting for each command line option is set internally in the 
program unless there is a corresponding line for it in the configuration file.  
Command line options always override default values.  

Some interesting options to play with are:

@table @code
@item -mode=640x480
Use this option to set the size of the display.

@item -canvas=sdl2d
Use this option to select the type of 2D canvas to use.

@item -video=opengl
(or software, ...).
Use this option to select type of display driver to use.  Other options
are @code{software}, @code{null}, etc.

@item -fs
Open in fullscreen mode (default is windowed).

@item -verbose
This enable very verbose output. This is useful for debugging why
Crystal Space isn't behaving as it should. If you just specify @samp{-verbose}
you will get a lot of output. If your problem is not @sc{scf} related
you can also do: @samp{-verbose=-scf}.

@item -relight
Use this option to recalculate all lightmaps after you changed lighting
or geometry in a level that you're trying. If you don't do this you either
get the old lightmaps or no lightmaps at all. Note that this command
is only for the old lightmap system as used by the thing mesh object.

@item -fullbright
Use this option to get fullbright rendering of all objects. This is useful
for debugging maps if you don't want to spend time relighting them first.

@item -plugin=@dots{}
This is a general commandline option with which you can load any plugin
into your application. One common option is to use this for loading
the @samp{bugplug} debugging plugin like this: @samp{-plugin=bugplug}.

@item -cfgset=@dots{}
With this commandline option you can set a configuration option on
the commandline. For example: @samp{-cfgset=Video.OpenGL.DelaySwap=yes}.

@item -cfgfile=@dots{}
This option loads an entire file to the configuration manager.
