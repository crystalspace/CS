@cindex Bug Reporting

If you find a bug in Crystal Space there are two ways to report it to the
developers. The preferred method of reporting bugs is to use the SourceForge
support request mechanism that can be found at:

@uref{https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=200649&group_id=649&func=browse}.

To use the SourceForge trackers, you must have a SourceForge user id,
and be logged in.

Additionally, you can send a message to the main Crystal Space mailing list
(@pxref{Mailing Lists}) at @email{crystal-main@@lists.sourceforge.net}.

@noindent
Try to give as much information as possible about the bug, including:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Crystal Space version number. If it is a @sc{cvs} snapshot then include
the time that you downloaded it. If you are using @sc{cvs} directly then
state when it was that you last did an update.
@item
Operating System (Windows (@emph{95, 98/SE/ME, NT4, 2000, XP}), MacOS/X, Unix
--- Linux, FreeBSD, etc. --- @dots{})
@item

@item
which renderer system you are using (old or new renderer).

@item
