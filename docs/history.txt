The history order is reversed so that new features are at the top.

4-Jul-2001
	- Added iCamera::SetTransform() which should be used to directly
	  set the transform. It is illegal to assign to the result of
	  iCamera::GetTransform() directly but I did not make the result
	  'const' since it is legal to do modifications on the returned
	  transform using other methods (like RotateThis() and SetPosition()).
	- Removed dungeon plugin and test app due to lack of maintenance.
	- Removed csgame plugin and test app due to lack of maintenance.
3-Jul-2001
	- Fixed the Python plugin after Martin's changes.
	- Added iEngine::GetCameraPosition() which takes a name as a parameter
	  instead of an index.
	- Fixed a warning in engine.cpp.
	- Added new apps/examples dir. This dir will contain small applications
	  that demonstrate a single feature.
	- Added apps/examples/cswseng which is a small app that demonstrates
	  how to use CSWS and Engine in same application. It is a derivative
	  from the old levtool but a few bugs are fixed and it is simpler.
	- Removed levtool since the demo functionality is no longer needed
	  (cswseng does this) and it is otherwise not functional.
	- Eric fixed the new CS_BEGIN_TYPED_IBASE_VECTOR_WITH_SUPERCLASS macro
	  so that it compiles error-free on NextStep.  It was reporting this
	  error: "type `foo' is derived from private `csIBaseVector'".  Also
	  made the TestIBaseVectorInhertiance() implementation more obvious.
	- Philip Wyett did the following changes:
		LoadPlugIn -> LoadPlugin
		QueryPlugIn -> QueryPlugin
		UnloadPlugIn -> UnloadPlugin
		RegisterPlugIn -> RegisterPlugin
		GetPlugIn -> GetPlugin
		GetPlugInCount -> GetPluginCount
		csPlugInsVector -> csPluginVector
		iSaverPlugIn -> iSaverPlugin
		FindPlugIn -> FindPlugin
		FindPlugInRec -> FindPluginRec
		ConfigPriorityPlugIn -> ConfigPriorityPlugin
		NewPlugIn -> NewPlugin
	  This change is a change of PlugIn for Plugin in
	  all instances inside the libs, plugins and apps.
	  Docs and config files also updated.
	- Fixed csEngine::FindMaterial(), FindTexture(), and FindSector()
	  so that they actually don't crash when they couldn't find
	  an object in the specified region. They were blindly doing
	  SCF_QUERY_INTERFACE without first checking if the returned
	  object was not-NULL.
	- Fixed an SCF bug in csRegion. It was doing SCF_DECLARE_IBASE
	  instead of SCF_DECLARE_IBASE_EXT.
	- Fixed a bug in csEngine::SelectRegion(). It would crash if
	  a NULL region was given.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a couple compilation warnings in surf.cpp
	  regarding possible use of unitialized variables.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a few minor problems with the SDL canvas which
	  prevented it from compiling.  Whether or not the canvas actually
	  works at run-time is unknown, but it does compile cleanly with the
	  the SDL 1.2.1 headers.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the special hack from the Apple/NeXT ports
	  which allowed the AppKit's run-loop to be invoked recursively.  This
	  feature is no longer required since CSWS no longer recursively
	  invokes iSystem::Loop().  Furthermore, this hack used private API of
	  the AppKit and relied upon implementation details of the AppKit's
	  black-box run-loop mechanism.  Therefore, by removing this code, the
	  Apple/NeXT ports are now 100% API clean (that is, they now use only
	  public AppKit API).
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated the unmaintained `ggi' and `mgl2d' canvases.
	- Wouter Wijngaards commented out -ldl on the LIBS line of the sdl
	  canvas. The SDL canvas works (--canvas=sdl2d option) for me on
	  mingw, SDL 1.2.0. Even gives a 4% speedup, over regular plugin :-)
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warnings about "non-virtual
	  destructor in class with virtual methods" from the following classes:
	  csModelDataObject, csModelDataCamera, csModelDataLight,
	  csModelDataMaterial, and csModelData.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings about implicit
	  conversion from double to integer in csEngine::SetAmbientLight().
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several problems in mdltest.mak and crossbld.mak
	  which prevented the modules from building correctly on Unix.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed csutil/crossbld.{h|cpp} to crossb.{h|cpp} in
	  order to avoid conflicts with the crossbld.o file which is generated
	  from plugins/mesh/crossbld/crossbld.cpp.  This is actually a
	  limitation of the current makefile system where all object files are
	  dumped into the same `out' directory, which means that no two source
	  files in the entire project can have the same name.  I plan to
	  address this problem sometime soon.
	- Philip Wyett fixed the SDL canvas so it does SDL_ShowCursor = true
	  on Open().
	- Philip also fixed SDL driver kicking out following message on Win32:
	  WARNING: Your operating system is not tested  yet with sdl2d
	  video driver.
	  SDL plugin works on Win98/SE/ME and Win2k. I cannot test on
	  NT4, but all seems to be well on OS's tested via VC6 buillds. :-)
	- Philip did some manual updates to VC project files.
	- Philip fixed Walktest after Eric renamed a few crossbuilder
	  include files.
	- Philip added CSTOOL to crossbld.mak to fix a link error on mingw.
	- Philip added crossbuld plugin to glbal process so mdltest works. :-/
	- Philip fixed an include error in mdltest.
	- Philip removed the EAX sound renderer due to lack of maintenance.
	- Brandon Ehle did the following:
	    - Fixed csLua scripting plugin and removed all global
	      variables where applicable. Changed the architecture such
	      that you use the global system variable rather than calling
	      GetSystem() at startup.
	    - Added some new classes to cs.i and fixed some existing problems.
	    - Regenerated both python and lua swig interfaces.
	    - Added the options -python and -lua to pysimple so that world
	      geometry doesn't get generated twice by both plugin tests.
	- Martin Geisse added iEngine::GetAmbientLight() and SetAmbientLight().
	- Martin also did the following:
	    - Fixed the header protectors in imesh/mdlconv.h and
	      imesh/mdldata.h (they had the wrong directory in their name).
	    - Moved all model data related classes to cstool. Although they
	      are primarily used by the model file converters, it also makes
	      sense to use them from elsewhere (for example, the
	      crossbuilder test app :-)
	    - Added a first implementation of the crossbuilder (a plugin that
	      can be used to create mesh objects from imported model files).
	      Currently it cannot do more than extract vertices and polygons
	      into things.
	    - Added a test app for the crossbuilder (mdltest).
2-Jul-2001
	- Removed the bad and global 'thisclass' pointer from the Python
	  plugin.  Removed the 'GetSystem()' call from 'cs.i'.  The Python
	  plugin now sets the pointer to iSystem in 'cspace.system' Python
	  variable.  So if a Python script does 'import cspace.*' then you can
	  just use 'system' in your script.  This change breaks the LUA plugin
	  though.  A similar change has to happen there but I don't know how.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the csPython plugin so that it once again
	  compiles cleanly under NextStep following the removal of `thisclass'.
	  The problem was that the NextStep compiler disallows C++ expressions
	  in functions which have been declared `extern "C"'.
	- Eric Sunshine added DSP.CSPYTHON.CFLAGS to cspython.mak to define
	  "SWIG_GLOBAL" for MSVC.
	- Eric Sunshine removed some outdated scripts from CS/scripts/blender.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the unneeded vfstest and textconv applications.
	- Eric Sunshine took advantage of the new iSystem::PerformExtensionV()
	  method which accepts a va_list argument in order to simplify the
	  system_extension() methods and plain-C forwarding wrappers in the
	  Apple/NeXT system driver and AppKit-based 2D driver.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from
	  cmdline.cpp and cmdline.h.
	- Michael Voasse made the following changes:
	    - In the ongoing quest to implement HitBeam() in all mesh objects,
  	      todays victims are cube and surface.  Both should now respond to
  	      bugplug and show their bounding boxen and radii.  I have
  	      optimized surface a little by adding a set of corner vertices to
  	      shortcut the bbox and HitBeamObject() methods.
	    - Fixed a small bug in csSector::HitBeam().  This now returns the
  	      closest intersection be it a mesh or polygon ( previously, was
  	      returning furthest mesh or polygon ).  Only the intersect vertex
  	      was affect, no other methods or fields were harmed during this
  	      procedure...
	- Martin Geisse updated apimod19.txi with his latest changes.
	- Martin also did the following:
	    - Removed csTextureWrapper::GetPrivateObject().
	    - Changed csMaterialList to derive from a typed vector.
	    - Sectors are now stored in a typed vector too. This vector has
	      its own interface, iSectorList. Removed all functions from
	      iEngine which are already available through iSectorList.
	- Martin made the following changes to the typed vector system:
	    - Moved all macros to their own header file, typedvec.h.
	    - Internally, an even more flexible macro is used that allows
	      usage of a user-defined superclass for the vector.
	    - Modified the vectors for SCF objects.  The contained class no
  	      longer needs to be defined at the time the vector is declared.
  	      On the bad side, it is now a requirement that the contained class
  	      must be a subclass of iBase.  It is no longer sufficient that the
  	      class has IncRef/DecRef methods.  However, this should not be too
  	      much of a limitation.
	    - Vectors for normal objects and for SCF objects again use the same
  	      concept in their macro hierarchy.
	- Martin also added a new system of object vectors:
	    - This system should finally replace csNamedObjVector.  The common
  	      superclass for those vectors is currently called
  	      csNamedObjectVector and is kept in the same source/header files.
  	      It extends the macros for typed vectors to produce type-safe
  	      object vectors.
	    - In addition, csNamedObjVector itself provides all methods that
  	      are safe even if you don't know the type of contained objects.
  	      In this case, the objects are exposed to the user as (iObject*)
  	      pointers.  This way you can deal with object vectors that store
  	      objects of unknown type, although the range of possible
  	      operations is of course limited.
	    - Finally, I re-implemented csTextureList using typed object
	      vectors. Seems to work so far.
	- To make sure our shift keys will not wear out too easily Philip
	  Wyett did the following changes:
	    csPlugIn -> csPlugin
	    iPlugIn -> iPlugin
	    scfiPlugIn -> scfiPlugin
	    iLoaderPlugIn -> iLoaderPlugin
	    eiPlugIn -> eiPlugin
	  This change is a change of PlugIn for Plugin in all instances inside
	  the libs, plugins and apps.  Work in progress...Hope will be finished
	  today...  Also removed my commit log which for some reason appeared
	  in some files :-/
	- Philip also did some work on documentation:
	    - Changed extlibs.txi to tell that winlibs is for those using the
	      MSVC compiler ONLY.  Have been meaning to do this for a while -
	      finally done.  :-)
	    - Modified dirhier.txi (CS dir hierarchy) for the csparser change
	      from library to plugin.
	    - In resource.txi: removed link pointing at 3D downloads as a D/L
	      location for CS releases.
	    - In faq.txi: Removed Borland C++ compiler from FAQ, what do I need
	      to compile Crystal Space.  This port is broken / never used, so
	      will be removed.
	    - In feedback.txi: added ones own name to copyright section.  Added
	      Windows XP to feedback/bug reporting docs.
	    - In cpyright.txi: added ones own name to copyright section.  Added
	      Windows XP to feedback/bug reporting docs.
1-Jul-2001
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the new cmdline.cpp and cmdline.h so that they
	  compile error-free with the NextStep compiler.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired a fundamental flaw in the new
	  csCommandLineParser class which caused most CS applications to crash.
	  The problem was that csCommandLineParser::Initialize() emptied the
	  option list (thus forgetting all existing options) before it
	  processed the incoming argv[] vector.  This had the unfortunate
	  side-effect of wiping out all iSystem::RequestPlugin() invocations
	  which had occurred prior to the call to Initialize(), thus requested
	  plugins were not being loaded, and programs would crash in the
	  absence of those plugins.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed the following methods for API consistency:
	    iSystem::SystemExtension()          --> PerformExtension()
	    iConsoleOutput::ConsoleExtension()  --> PerformExtension()
	    iConsoleOutput::ConsoleExtensionV() --> PerformExtentionV()
	  These names now complement the existing PerformExtension() method of
	  iGrahpics2D.
	- Eric Sunshine added PerformExtensionV(va_list) variations to iSystem
	  and iGraphics2D to complement the existing PerformExtension(...)
	  methods.  Note that iConsoleOutput already had a
	  PerformExtensionV(va_list) method, so no changes were needed there.
	  The actual worker code in all the csSystemDriver and csGraphics2D
	  subclasses is now contained in PerformExtensionV() rather than
	  PerformExtension(), and PerformExtension() is now implemented as a
	  very thin wrapper over PerformExtensionV().
	- Eric Sunshine added iSystem::PrintfV(va_list) to complement the
	  existing Printf(...) method.  Printf() is now implemented as a very
	  thin wrapper over PrintfV().
	- Eric Sunshine renamed csApp::printf(...) to Printf(...) and also
	  added a PrintfV(va_list) variation.  Printf() is now implemented as a
	  very thin wrapper over PrintfV().
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning about
	  csMeshFactoryWrapper having private destructor but no `friend'.
	- Philip Wyett did the following:
	    - Added forward declaration struct csFog (to thing.h).  This fixes
	      compile error in Python plugin.
	    - Changed some CrystalBall internal naming:
	        - class crysVec -> class csCrystalBallVec
	        - class trinode -> class csTriNode
	      These 2 changes do not affect app writers...
	    - Added another CSTOOL to eliminate link error for csdemo on MingW.
	    - Changed cs_time to csTime.  Now follows CS naming convention more
	      closely and generally is a heck of alot more
	      distinguishable/readable in code.  :-)
	    - Removed some no longer in existence includes from python plugin.
	      Manually updated VC project files.
	    - More function name standardization:
		do_key ()    -> DoKey ()
		do_button () -> DoButton ()
		do_motion () -> DoMotion ()
		debug_out () -> DebugTextOut ()
		console_out  -> ConsoleOut ()
		cleanup and CleanUp -> Cleanup ()
		sys_fatalerror () -> SystemFatalError ()
	    - Fixed on exit crasher under Windows for demosky.
	    - Fixed "sys_fatalerror" to report a fatal error is in
	      "glwin32.dll" and not "OpenGL2D.dll"
	- Martin Geisse did the following:
	    - Added iSector::Draw(), iThingState::HasFog() and
	      iThingState::GetFog ().
	    - Some changes to use engine-related objects though interfaces.
	    - Removed several forward and 'friend' declarations of the Dumper
	      class.
	    - Cleanup of the curve code.  Added some missing methods.
	      Materials are now correctly reference-counted.  Functions are
	      sorted by class in the file, and bezier-specific code is clearly
	      separated from the rest.
	    - Moved csMapNode and csView from csengine to cstool.
	    - Updated simple tutorial to take account of changes.
	    - Continued to split up csparser into several files.  Also renamed
	      some functions to keep a uniform naming style.  None of these
	      changes affects the interface.
	    - Removed the global 'System' variable.  Applications can still use
	      their own global system variable, but then they must define it
	      themselves.  Some of the CS applications do that.  The Win32
	      system driver also requires a global system variable and thus
	      defines it, but it does so as a 'static' variable to avoid
	      pollution of the global namespace.  WARNING: He could only test
	      this for Win32 / MSVC!
	    - Updated the documentation to take account of the removal of the
	      global system variable.
	    - Fixed a compile error in g2d.cpp.
30-Jun-2001
	- Martin Geisse did the following:
	    - Removed the SoundDriver, NetworkDriver and MotionManager members
	      from the system driver because they are not used anywhere.
	    - Removed command line parsing code out of the system driver and
	      into its own class which is then used by the system driver.
29-Jun-2001
	- Got an Insure log from Philip Wyett.  Using this I fixed a number of
	  small problems and one rather bad problem.  The bad problem that is
	  fixed is:
	    - Terrain visibility had a memory overwrite bug with the horizontal
	      index lookup table.
	- Added 'csparser' to 'make walkall' target.
	- Fix to python plugin for csparser.
	- Fixed the balls in csdemo.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired a bad assumption which plagued most SCF
	  interfaces implemented by plugin modules.  The problem was that most
	  such interfaces inherited from iPlugIn rather than iBase.  This made
	  the potentially invalid assumption that these interfaces would always
	  be implemented as plugin modules.  The reason that this is an invalid
	  assumption is that the packaging into a plugin is merely an
	  implementation detail.  For instance, since the iImageIO interface
	  was derived from iPlugIn, all image loaders were expected to
	  implement HandleEvent(), which is a rather silly requirement for an
	  image loader.  All interfaces which were inheriting from iPlugIn now
	  instead inherit from iBase.  Actual plugin modules now directly
	  implement iPlugIn, as well as implementing the various interfaces
	  which used to be derived from iPlugIn.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a number of canvas implementations which were
	  using SCF_DECLARE_IBASE() and SCF_IMPLEMENT_IBASE() rather than the
	  _EXT() versions.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a number of 2D canvases which implemented
	  iEventPlug but neglected to mention iEventPlug in the
	  SCF_IMPLEMENT_IBASE() block.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated the cscmdConsoleStatusChange event and
	  re-implemented this notification facility via an SCF class named
	  iConsoleWatcher.
	- Eric Sunshine augmented `haspython.sh' so that it now also checks
	  /usr/local/python in addition to /usr and /usr/local.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the `soft' makefile target to `soft3d' to be
	  consistent with other renderer targets such as `gl3d', `null3d', and
	  `line3d'; and to disambiguate from the "software" sound renderer.
	  Also changed `infinite' target to `inf3d'.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed FindBone() and FindFrameSet() to csFindBone()
	  and csFindFrameSet() in order to avoid pollution of the global
	  namespace.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the obsolete igraphic/loader.h header.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the cumbersom, ill-conceived and
	  monolithic-oriented csSystemDriver::CheckDrivers() method.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the csjava plugin since it was completely
	  unimplemented.
	- Eric Sunshine added a "CS_" prefix to the following platform-specific
	  configuration macros:
	    SOFTWARE_2D_DRIVER --> CS_SOFTWARE_2D_DRIVER
	    OPENGL_2D_DRIVER   --> CS_OPENGL_2D_DRIVER
	    GLIDE_2D_DRIVER    --> CS_GLIDE_2D_DRIVER
	    SOUND_DRIVER       --> CS_SOUND_DRIVER
	- Eric Sunshine added a "CS_" prefix to the following csVector-related
	  macros.  Furthermore, DECLARE_TYPED_SCF_VECTOR has been renamed to
	  CS_DECLARE_TYPED_IBASE_VECTOR in order to more clearly indicate that
	  this array type works with reference-counted iBase objects.
	    BEGIN_TYPED_VECTOR()       --> CS_BEGIN_TYPED_VECTOR()
	    FINISH_TYPED_VECTOR()      --> CS_FINISH_TYPED_VECTOR()
	    DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR()     --> CS_DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR()
	    DECLARE_TYPED_SCF_VECTOR() --> CS_DECLARE_TYPED_IBASE_VECTOR()
	    DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR_HELPER()
		--> CS_CS_DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR_HELPER()
	    DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR_NODELETE()
		--> CS_CS_DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR_NODELETE()
	- Eric Sunshine added a "CS_" prefix to the following `sysdef' request
	  macros.  Furthermore, each macro name now contains the word "provide"
	  since these macros are used by client code to request that
	  cssysdef.h provides certain facilities.
	    SYSDEF_ACCESS  --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_ACCESS
	    SYSDEF_ALLOCA  --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_ALLOCA
	    SYSDEF_CASE    --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_CASE
	    SYSDEF_DIR     --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_DIR
	    SYSDEF_GETCWD  --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_GETCWD
	    SYSDEF_GETOPT  --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_GETOPT
	    SYSDEF_MKDIR   --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_MKDIR
	    SYSDEF_PATH    --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_PATH
	    SYSDEF_SELECT  --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_SELECT
	    SYSDEF_SOCKETS --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_SOCKETS
	    SYSDEF_TEMP    --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_TEMP
	    SYSDEF_UNLINK  --> CS_SYSDEF_PROVIDE_UNLINK
	- Eric Sunshine updated apimod19.txi to mention the above macro name
	  changes.
	- Martin Geisse fixed several compilation errors in g2d_dd8.cpp,
	  wodrv.cpp, video.cpp, and texfile.cpp.
	- Martin moved several functions out of csloader.cpp and in their own
	  source files, grouped by their purpose.  This is an attempt to make
	  the loader code more readable.
	- Norman Kramer fixed CallOnEvent in glx2d.cpp.
	- Norman fixed bumptest.cpp and demo.cpp (loader -> imageio).
28-Jun-2001
	- Fixed error handling in spr2dldr (for mixmode) a little.
	- Added error reporting to ballldr (using reporter plugin).
	- Added back some include files from WalkTest that Martin removed
	  but which are needed hard.
	- Richard D. Shank added header files for 3ds importer.
	- Richard made the start to moving terrain object to a mesh object.
	  I continued his work. terrfunc is now a mesh object like all others.
	  There is a new newsky.zip on the ftp site for this change.
	- This also means that TERRAINFACTORY and TERRAINOBJ are gone in
	  map files (use MESHFACT and MESHOBJ). Everything related to
	  terrains is gone from the engine. A terrain is a mesh object.
	- The engine also had functions for manipulating terrains in
	  iEngine, iRegion, and iSector. These are now gone.
	- Fixed WalkTest terrain dynamic lighting for this change.
	- Fixed WalkTest terrain collision detection for this change.
	- Fixed BugPlug ability to enable/disable vistesting for terrains.
	- Added SCF_SET_REF() to safely set a reference in a variable.  This
	  will make sure the old reference (if any) gets released and the new
	  reference will be increased.  Will safely work in combination with
	  NULL.
	- Martin Geisse removed lots of unneeded include statements from
	  walktest and squawk.  Also made some changes to squawk, so it now
	  uses the engine only through interfaces.
	- Martin also did:
	    - Renamed BEGIN_TYPED_VECTOR_EXT to BEGIN_TYPED_VECTOR and
	      END_TYPED_VECTOR_EXT to FINISH_TYPED_VECTOR.
	    - Added GetArray() to typed vectors which returns the array of
	      pointers as a (TYPE**) pointer.
	    - Cleaned up the arrays from csengine/arrays.cpp using typed
	      vectors.
	    - Changed DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR slightly.  The user-defined
	      FreeTypedItem method must now be given as a complete function
	      (i.e. with function name and brackets).  This makes it possible
	      to move the implementation outside the macro call and also to add
	      other user-defined methods.
	    - Removed the non-const operator [] from SCF vectors again. It
	      is unsafe because it allows to replace items but ignore their
	      reference count.
	    - Did a little cleanup in mdldata.h.
	    - Added 'position' member to csModelDataLight.
	    - Added 'GetRefCount' Implementation to all model data components.
	    - Removed two unneeded include lines from win32.h.
	- Martin Geisse moved the csparser library to a plugin.
	- Martin Geisse updated documentation to reflect the csparser changes.
	- Martin changed the crossbuilder class to take an (iSystem*) as a
	  parameter in the constructor instead of using the global system
	  variable.
	- Martin moved the converter, crossbuilder and sound wrapper classes
	  from csparser to cstool.
	- Philip Wyett created the makefiles for the new csparser plugin and
	  did various other makefile/dsp changes related to this.
	- Philip moved "DirectDetection" out of the Win32 portion of the
	  system library and created a "directxcommon" repository from
	  where the files can be picked up in plugins for which they are
	  needed. This pre-empts the known removal of CSSYS and fixes an
	  anomoly where this code was being compiled twice.
	  Once into CSSYS and then in DirectX related plugins.
	  Tested with MingW and VC and is fine. :-)
	  May need cleaning up, Work in progress...
	- Philip added ddraw and zlib to plugin.tpl, appgui.tpl, and appcon.tpl
	  as compiling with VC and the Insure++ runtime debugger throws out
	  link errors. :-(
	- Philip added CSGFX to demo.mak and csgamtst.mak to make compatible
	  for building with MSVC and Parasoft Insure++ runtime debugger.
	- Philip fixed some bad returns from void functions in terrain
	  plugin.
	- Michael Voasse did the following:
	    - First installment in the HitBeamObject() updates. First victim
	      is ball. *WARNING* I have reset the size of the ball back to its
	      correct value. What was being declared as a RADIUS, was in fact,
	      the diameter. Ball now works, but there are some problems with
	      hard transforms, and they are all twice the size they used to be.
	    - I have also added a few small bugfixs to csloader incorrectly
	      returning a false, instead of a NULL. Probably overlooked
	      earlier...
27-Jun-2001
	- Renamed csFilenameMatches() to csGlobMatches() because it is
	  useful for more than just filenames (in csutil).
	- Added a new 'reporter' plugin. This is going to be used for
	  error reporting and message reporting in general. In order to use
	  this reporter, the application has to load the plugin. When
	  the reporter is present other plugins will use it to report
	  errors. If no reporter plugin is present then no reporting
	  will happen.
	- Fully support the reporter plugin in spr2dldr.
	- Fully support the reporter plugin in spr3dldr.
	- WalkTest now loads the reporter plugin and uses it to test
	  if the loading of the level succeeded.
	- Fixed the level loader so that it now returns failure when
	  loading mesh objects fail. The map loader will also report
	  more errors to the reporter.
	- Also fixed the map loader so that it will check for errors
	  almost everywhere and return false/NULL if so.
	- Martin Geisse added documentation about the changes to SCF,
	  csObject and the pseudo-RTTI system to apimod19.
	- Wouter Wijngaards removed maze from isotest as it corrupts display
	  in opengl. Not sure why yet.
	- Philip Wyett did a manual commit to ogl_g3dcom.cpp to stop VC
	  bitching about a bad CR in the file.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the now obsolete csevQuitLoop event.  This is
	  not needed anymore since CSWS no longer invokes iSystem::Loop()
	  recursively.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the csSystemDriver::ExitLoop instance variable
	  and all associated support code.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the following outdated documents from the
	  CS/docs/incoming directory: collide.txt, csupdate.txt, extmodel.txt,
	  glossary.tex, makecreat.tex, mazed.html, mazed.txi,
	  mazed_interface.html, mazed_preface.html, mazed_tutorial.html,
	  octree.tex.  Also removed the following files from the
	  CS/docs/incoming/images directory: cswhite.jpg, csws.gif, MazeD.gif,
	  ObjMaker.gif, smalllogo.jpg, smcslogo.jpg, texture6.gif, tutor1.gif,
	  tutor2.gif.
	- Eric Sunshine added a new glossary.txi to the Appendix in the user's
	  manual.  This is based upon the old glossary.tex from the `incoming'
	  directory.
	- Eric Sunshine moved the content of CS/docs/incoming/csupdate.txt
	  directly into the csupdate.py script.  This information is now
	  accessed via the --detailed-help option.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a float-to-int compilation warning from
	  isotest.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the SCF name for the 3D engine from
	  crystalspace.engine.core to crystalspace.engine.3d in order to
	  complement the existing crystalspace.engine.iso SCF class name.
	- Eric Sunshine added the CS_HEADER_GLOBAL() and CS_HEADER_LOCAL()
	  preprocessor macros to cssysdef.h.  These macros are used to compose
	  header file include paths.  This is useful in cases where the
	  location of a header file varies from platform to platform and one
	  does not have the opportunity to augment the preprocessor's header
	  file search path.  For instance, on most platforms, OpenGL headers
	  are located in a `GL' subdirectory, however on other platforms they
	  are located in an `OpenGL' subdirectory.  For instance, assuming that
	  a platform has defined the preprocessor macro GLPATH with the value
	  `OpenGL', then it can include the gl.h header by invoking:
	    #include CS_HEADER_GLOBAL(GLPATH,gl.h)
	- Eric Sunshine adjusted plugins/video/renderer/opengl and
	  plugins/video/canvas/openglcommon to respect the OpenGL path
	  specified via CS_OPENGL_PATH by utilizing the new CS_HEADER_GLOBAL()
	  macro when including OpenGL headers.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several Texinfo mark-up problems which were
	  introduced into apimod19.txi.  Also rewrite and clarified several
	  portions of the new SCF, csObject, and RTTI documentation in
	  apimod19.txi.
26-Jun-2001
	- Philip updated the win32gcc.txi doc to add explanation about
	  PYTHONPATH environment variable.
	- Fixed a problem in apimod19.txi. The document incorrectly stated
	  that you had to do SCF_QUERY_INTERFACE() in order to get the
	  pointer to VFS, G3D, and other plugins from the system driver.
	  This should be CS_QUERY_PLUGIN().
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several minor issues in the Texinfo files.
	  Also upgraded apimod19.txi to mention CS_QUERY_PLUGIN_ID() rather
	  than CS_QUERY_PLUGIN().
	- Did a fundamental change in CSWS. csApp::Execute() is
	  removed as it did some very bad recursive system loop calling.
	  This prevented us from doing a proper redesign of the system
	  driver. Instead there is now a csApp::StartModal() and
	  csApp::StopModal(). For the GUI user the effect is that of modality
	  (i.e. there is no difference with calling Execute() from the view-
	  point of the user: the top-modal dialog has focus and all other
	  components are disabled). However it will not be modal for the
	  application. StartModal() returns immediatelly. Instead you have
	  to wait for the cscmdStopModal command which will be called
	  to the csApp::HandleEvent() when the modality has finished. LevTool,
	  CSWSTest, and csfedit have been fixed for this. MazeD hasn't been
	  fixed and will soon be removed.
	- A change which is related to this is that csMessageBox() now
	  returns immediatelly. If you are interested in the result you need
	  to catch the cscmdStopModal command and see if the userdata
	  implements iMessageBoxData. If so then you have the result from
	  csMessageBox().
	- Removed MazeD (it doesn't work anymore). I put the source of
	  MazeD in a zip file at ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/crystal.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed CS/mk/static.mak to account for new "SCF_" prefix
	  on SCF_REGISTER_STATIC_LIBRARY().
	- Eric Sunshine fixed 3dsout.cpp so that it now emits `CULLER' rather
	  than the obsolete `STATBSP' keyword.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired some Texinfo mark-up problems which were
	  introduced into apimod19.txi.  Also rewrote some of the newly added
	  discussion and repaired several `overfull hbox' warnings reported by
	  TeX.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the now obsolete MazeD.cfg and MazeD.zip.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added a randomly generated maze to isotest
	  application.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a small compile problem in iso engine.
	- Michael Voasse implemented radius calculation on metaball,
	  'borrowed' HitBeamObject code from sprite3d and fixed shape
	  number update.
25-Jun-2001
	- Added iBase::GetRefCount(). This way you can now get the reference
	  counter from any SCF interface. Note that this is ONLY for debugging
	  purposes! Any misuse of this function for anything but debugging
	  will be severly punished! :-)
	- BugPlug now has the ability to select a mesh on screen (by clicking
	  on it). It will automatically detect when the mesh is deleted and
	  correctly unselect it then. BugPlug uses the new GetRefCount()
	  function to do that (yes! BugPlug is about debugging, so it can
	  do that!)
	- Eliminated csEngine and iEngine::NextFrame(). Now this is done
	  automatically in csEngine::Draw() and DrawFunc().
	- Made iSector::HitBeam() a little bit more efficient and also
	  fixed a small bug: the polygon was not filled in.
	- Fixed csMeshWrapper::HitBeam() so that it now takes the full
	  transform instead of the transform. That way it works for
	  hierarchical objects too.
	- Fixed a bad bug in Spider (BugPlug). DecRef() was called on Spider
	  before it was removed from the engine. This has recently been
	  forbidden. This bug caused BugPlug to crash whenever Spider catched
	  a camera.
	- Added 'meshbbox' and 'meshrad' commands in BugPlug. 'meshbbox'
	  shows the bounding box of the currently selected mesh. 'meshrad'
	  shows the bounding sphere of the currently selected mesh.
 	- BugPlug is the hiding place for many dark creatures. While Spider
	  only places a curse on the country and any unsuspecting wanderer
	  that might visit the country, Shadow takes possession of some
	  creature and clings to it with all its power. Unless Shadow
	  willingly releases the creature there is nothing that can be done
	  to unbind Shadow. The Shadow slowly devours the poor creature from
	  all its knowledge.
	- Fixed a small bug in BugPlug. The new Shadow mesh object is now
	  added with a higher render priority (the one from the alpha
	  channel) to ensure that it gets rendered later.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem with mdl2spr where it failed to load
	  the PNG plugin.  Also fixed it so that it only attempts to load the
	  PNG plugin if absolutely required (for instance, to save skins from
	  Quake1 MDL files), rather than loading it unconditionally.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the doubled `cscs' prefix on the following
	  functions:
	    cscsByteSwap16bitBuffer()
	    cscsByteSwap32bitBuffer()
	- Eric Sunshine altered the OpenGL renderer so that it builds cleanly
	  on MacOS/X.  The following changes were made:
	    - Added a new preprocessor flag, CS_OPENGL_PATH, which indicates
	      where OpenGL header files live.  If CS_OPENGL_PATH is defined,
	      then header files are included from that directory rather than
	      the standard "GL" directory.  This is needed on MacOS/X, since
	      OpenGL headers live in a subdirectory named "OpenGL" rather than
	      the standard "GL" as with most other platforms.
	    - Added CFLAGS.GL3D and LIBS.OPENGL.SYSTEM to macosx.mak with
	      appropriate values.
	    - Added a NEXT.PLUGINS variable to the Apple/NeXT makefiles and
	      defined it with the value "video/renderer/opengl" in macosx.mak
	      so that the OpenGL renderer makefile is consulted when building
	      on MacOS/X.
	    - Added a definition of OPENGL_2D_DRIVER to next/csosdefs.h.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed ogl_halo.cpp so that it no longer unnecessarily
	  includes <windows.h>.
	- Michael Voasse added half of the animation documentation. He
	  added the links accidentally during his last commit, so he added
	  what he had completed so far.
	- Michael also added SetVertices() methods to Sprite3d, modified
	  metagen to hand over the pointer to its vertex buffer (and all
	  the other arrays it uses ).
	- Michael added some further documentation to tesselat.h to explain
	  what it does and how it does it.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated references to non-existent motion.txi and
	  skelbone.txi from anim.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed numerous Texinfo mark-up problems and other
	  related errors in the new texinfo/plugins/anim documentation.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the documentation in tesselat.h so that
	  Doxygen will be able to make use of it.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the new SetTexels(), SetVertices(), SetNormals(),
	  and SetTriangles() methods which were added to the 3D sprite class so
	  that the array argument is now `const'.  This helps to indicate that
	  the incoming array is not intended for modification.  Also clarified
	  the documentation to make this point painfully clear.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following name changes throughout the project
	  in order to avoid global namespace pollution:
	    - All SCF macros are now prefixed by "SCF_".
	    - All MSG_BLAH macros are now prefixed by "CS_".
	    - All QUERY_PLUGIN macros are now prefixed by "CS_".
	    - All LOAD_PLUGIN macros are now prefixed by "CS_".
	    - All IS_BLAH_EVENT macros are now prefixed by "CS_".
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warnings about unused variables
	  in metasys.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine added documentation to apimod19.txi for the recent API
	  changes regarding SCF_ and CS_ prefixes.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated all overfull and underfull `hbox' warnings
	  reported by TeX following the API changes regarding the SCF_ and CS_
	  prefixes.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the Apple/NeXT ports so that they access the
	  `next.cfg' configuration file via iConfigManager rather than
	  iConfigFile.  This allows application, plugin module, and
	  user-specific configuration options to override options from
	  `next.cfg'.
	- Eric Sunshine added a "NeXT." prefix to keys in `next.cfg' in order
	  to distinguish them from keys in other configuration files.  This was
	  necessary since the Apple/NeXT ports now access configuration
	  information from `next.cfg' via iConfigManager, rather than
	  iConfigFile,
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the installation path
	  gleaning mechanism:
	    - Added class method csSystemDriver::InstallPath().  Since this is
	      a class method, installation path information is now available to
	      clients even when no iSystem is available.  This may be useful
	      for certain utility programs which never actually instantiate a
	      system driver.
	    - csSystemDriver now implements iSystem::GetInstallPath() as a
	      simple wrapper over the class method InstallPath().
	    - Added libs/cssys/unix/instpath.cpp which implements
	      csSystemDriver::InstallPath() for Unix platforms.
	    - Added libs/cssys/win32/instpath.cpp which implements
	      csSystemDriver::InstallPath() for Windows.
	    - Added libs/cssys/general/instpath.cpp which generically
	      implments csSystemDriver::InstallPath() for other platforms.
	    - Adjusted makefiles and project files to reference the new
	      instpath.cpp source files as appropriate.
	    - Eliminated the apparently useless PS2 override of
	      iSystem::GetInstallPath().
	- Eric Sunshine modified the Apple/NeXT plugin loading mechanism so
	  that it utilizes the new csSystemDriver::InstallPath() method so that
	  installed plugin modules may be found even when a system driver has
	  not been intantiated.  (Not every application instantiates a system
	  driver.)  Previously, NeXTSystemDriver::Initialize() was responsible
	  for adding the `install path' to the plugin module search list, but
	  this is now handled entirely by the plugin loading mechanism.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the PS2 system driver so that it no longer
	  includes the Unix port's system driver header (cssys/unix.h).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a couple problems with bugplug.mak.  First, it
	  neglected to install its configuration file `bugplug.cfg' at `make
	  install' time.  Second, it failed to add `bugplug.cfg' to the
	  generated MSVC DSP file.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a couple problems with simpcon.mak.  First, it
	  neglected to install its configuration file `simpcon.cfg' at `make
	  install' time.  Second, it failed to add `simpcon.cfg' to the
	  generated MSVC DSP file.
	- Philip Wyett removed "vc_asm.inc" and all it's supposed assembler
	  optimizations from CSGEOM and other programs. These when not broken
	  in fact offer no real optimization than the VC 6 compiler
	  generated code.
	- Philip removed now under DX8 COM helper FINAL_RELEASE. Also
	  aids in compliance for CS eventually being able to be used for
	  XBox Development.
	- Philip fixed a compiler warning in mdl2spr.
	- Philip fixed some documentation about Win32 port. Added links to
	  ftp.sunsite.dk.
	- Wouter Wijngaards tested the use of multiple grids. This works fine.
	    - Fixed groundhitbeam to also work when the beam is (partially)
	      outside the grid. You can thus make lights the are positioned
	      outside a grid (say in another grid) and shine to the grid.
	      So you can add two identical lights, to two grids, to have them
	      both seem affected by the 'same' light.
	    - Isotest now has a 2nd grid, more playground :-)
24-Jun-2001
	- 'Fixed' the lightmap overflow bug in software renderer. It is
	  not really an elegant bug fix as I simply test for overflow
	  but it seems to work.
	- Correctly implemented GetRadius() for the sprite2d mesh object.
	- Optimized skeletal sprite bounding box calculation by doing
	  the calculation on the vertices instead of the bounding box
	  if a limb has less than 8 vertices. Even if the limb has slightly
	  more than 8 vertices we also do this for the increased accuracy
	  this gets us.
	- Calculation of radius for 3D sprites is now very accurate and
	  correctly accounts for current frame and skeletal state.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired DemoSequenceLoader::LoadPath() so that it no
	  longer allocates 10,000 element arrays of `float' and 'csVector3' on
	  the stack, since such huge arrays are frequently unportable.  In this
	  case, they blew the OpenStep stack, resulting in abnormal program
	  termination.
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a complaint from the compiler about
	  csCameraPosition, csMaterialWrapper and csTextureWrapper having
	  private destructors but no friends.
22-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a bug in Walktest with the deletion of the legs/body
	  collider. They were deleted with DecRef() but that is illegal
	  since it is now required that they are deleted with
	  engine->RemoveMesh().
	- Implemented RemoveFromCache() in OpenGL 3D renderer. This is
	  important for dynamic worlds because when a polygon is deleted
	  the OpenGL renderer would not release information associated with
	  that polygon. In particular the lightmap data was not released.
	- Fixed a missing DecRef() on iThingState in the thing loader. That
	  would leak a reference.
	- Fixed a missing DecRef() in the thing loader when loading polygons.
	- Removed csPolygonArrayNoFree. It is not used.
	- Fixed a bug in csSector::FollowSegment(). It would not
	  work correctly for null portals. Now it correctly detects
	  that case.
	- Removed the ref from csPolyTexture to csPolygon3D. It is a
	  circular reference.
	- Worked on a very old bug in the software renderer texture cache.
	  Actually I tried to worked around the bug. I don't understand the
	  real nature of the bug though. The code is commented because
	  it doesn't work correctly yet. There are also underflows it seems!
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem with csSystemDriver::LoadPlugIn() where
	  the returned object had an inconsistent reference count.  In some
	  cases, the caller of LoadPlugIn() was responsible for invoking
	  DecRef() on the returned object to dispose of it, but in other cases
	  the system driver maintained authority over the returned object and
	  the caller was not allowed to invoke DecRef().  Now, the reference
	  count of the returned object is consistent in all cases, and the
	  caller must _always_ invoke DecRef() to dispose of the returned
	  object.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the unused and namespace-polluting ResultType
	  enumeration from ivaria/script.h
	- Eric Sunshine updated the URLs in the build instructions for the
	  Apple/NeXT ports to refer to the new sunsite.dk location rather than
	  the old 3ddownloads.com location.
	- Eric Sunshine updated the "Final Notes" section of the
	  platform-specific internal-description of the Apple/NeXT ports.
21-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a bug in the cleanup of sectors in the engine.  The portal
	  references were not cleaned up.
	- Made the destructors of the following classes private:
	    - csTextureWrapper
	    - csMaterialWrapper
	    - csCollection
	    - csSector
	    - csMeshFactoryWrapper
	    - csTerrainFactoryWrapper
	    - csCurveTemplate
	    - csCameraPosition
	- Removed csCurveTemplateArray. It was not used.
	- csThing no longer puts itself in the current region.  That is not
	  needed since csMeshWrapper already does that.
	- Completely reworked the callback system for portals.  A portal
	  callback is no longer a function.  Instead it is an SCF class
	  (iPortalCallback) that you have to implement.  This allows cleanup of
	  that callback when the portal is deleted.  There are also two types
	  of portal callback now:
	     - Missing sector: this is the old type. When a sector is missing
	       (null portal) this will be called.
	     - Portal callback: this will be called when the sector is not
	       missing.
	- Made a few things in the Window canvases static (ddraw, ddraw8, and
	  glwin32) so that they can be static linked with each other.
	- Fixed static linking for apps using the engine as a plugin by adding
	  engine/3d to the PLUGINS section (instead of PLUGINS.DYNAMIC) in
	  mk/user.mak.
	- Fixed a bug in csMeshWrapper::DecRef() and
	  csTerrainWrapper::DecRef().  The custom code there would do
	  scfRefCount++ in the assumption that the engine would decrease it
	  again.  But this only happens if the object was in the engine which
	  is not always the case (in fact it should never be the case now).  So
	  this was a big memory leak.  I kept the custom DecRef() and put some
	  testing code there (using CS_ASSERT) to make sure that it is not
	  misused.
	- Fixed handling of csRegion::DeleteAll(). It should now work a lot
	  better and actually delete everything.
	- Replaced csDrawCallback with iMeshDrawCallback (similar to the
	  iPortalCallback).  This new callback can even return false to prevent
	  the drawing to take place.
	- Replaced csMeshCallback with iMeshObjectDrawCallback.  Can now also
	  prevent drawing.
	- Replaced csDrawFunc with iDrawFuncCallback.
	- Norman Kramer removed UnlinkCollection() from csEngine.
	- Norman added missing DecRef() of iMeshObjectType in engine.cpp.
	- Norman fixed a stupid typo Jorrit made in the calling of the callback
	  in the spr3d plugin.
	- Norman says: due to wrong method signature of csPlugIn::FreeItem
	  it did not override and hence never got called.
	- Norman added meshwrapper removal in csEngine::Clear().
	- Norman fixed iso engine after Jorrit broke it due to the callback
	  changes (uses new iDrawFuncCallback).
	- Fixed a problem with the transparent sphere in flarge.
	- Eric Sunshine removed several outdated DO_BLAH references from
	  the documentation, and from mac/volatile.h and win32/volatile.h
	- Christopher Nelson did the following to AWS:
	    - Implemented children for components.
	    - IMplemented almost all of the redraw algorithm.
	- Philip Wyett fixed ptlab (changed delete to DecRef()).
20-Jun-2001
	- Made the resolving of portals to sectors a bit more robust
	  by not resolving portals that point to sectors that already
	  contain geometry.
	- The CS loader will now by default call DeferUpdateLighting()
	  on all loaded meshes (except the ones loaded with
	  LoadMeshObject(char*filename)) so that the lighting looks ok
	  directly after loading.
	- Added iEngine::SelectRegion() which accepts an iRegion as a
	  parameter.
	- Added iRegion::GetPrivateObject().
	- Fixed region handling for mesh wrappers (calls DecRef() now).
	- Added iReference and iReferencedObject.
	  This is a general system to keep references (iReference) to any
	  kind of object (iReferencedObject). If some object wants to keep
	  track of all other objects which hold a reference to this object
	  then it can implement iReferencedObject and the other objects can
	  implement iReference. When the referenced object is deleted it
	  will call SetReferencedObject(NULL) on all the references.
	- iPortal now subclasses iReference.
	- csSector now implements iReferencedObject.
	- By implementing this it is now safe to delete a sector. All portals
	  to that sector will be automatically set to NULL portals (i.e.
	  closed). If the portal has a callback associated with it then
	  this will be called the next time the engine needs that portal.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the following problems in win32gcc.txi:
	    - Repaired some incorrect Texinfo mark-up.
	    - Removed a redundant @noindent.
	    - Re-wrote the new Troubleshooting section in order to eliminate
	      sentence fragments and other incomprehensible wordage.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem in iCamera::GetSector() where the
	  compiler didn't like casting (void*) to (iSector*).  This occurs on
	  some platforms where NULL is defined as ((void*)0).
	- Eric Sunshine worked around an OpenStep compiler bug where it emitted
	  assembly with an unresolveable symbol for the csClipInfo class.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated the hard-coded maximum framerate limitation
	  (15 frames per second) from the Apple/NeXT ports.  Rather than using
	  a timer to trigger calls to iSystem::NextFrame() at a fixed interval
	  (15 times per second), it now feeds a dummy event into the AppKit's
	  event queue after each call to NextFrame(), which triggers a
	  subsequent call to NextFrame(), etc.  This allows the frame rate to
	  run as high as the hardware allows rather than artificially limiting
	  it to a timer's fixed interval.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed the bug where perftest incorrectly reported
	  the fps when spacebar was pressed to advance to the next test.
	- Fixed SCF stuff in csMaterialWrapper, csTextureWrapper,
	  csCameraPosition, and csMapNode.  Please don't use CONSTRUCT_IBASE
	  (NULL) for classes that get iBase from a superclass.
	- csPortal now also extends csObject and embeds iPortal instead of
	  inheriting from it.  Added iPortal::QueryObject().
19-Jun-2001
	- Removed verbose output of lightmap calculation if recalculation
	  of lighting is not enabled. Now the progress bars are only
	  displayed when lighting is actually being calculated.
	- Removed some totally useless init message in the parser with regards
	  to lightmap cell size.
	- Added iLightingInfo class which encapsulates lighting systems
	  for mesh objects. Currently only thing mesh objects implement
	  this. This class contains method to initialize lighting and
	  also for lighting cache management.
	- Removed all lightmap related stuff from iSector. This is now
	  handled by the thing mesh object.
	- Removed all lightmap related stuff from iThingState.
	- Fixed a bug in the 'portal' command. It would try to query
	  iMeshWrapper from the iMeshObject. Note that this fix doesn't
	  fix the crash though.
	- Changed the name of the cached lightmaps again. This means that
	  levels will be black unless you use -recalc or -relight!
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the documentation:
	    - Fixed a slew of Texinfo mark-up problems in dirhier.txi and
	      apimod19.txi.
	    - Performed clean-up and unification of the new material added to
	      apimod19.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem in linux.mak, hurd.mak, and freebsd.mak
	  where the values of SYSCONFIG and MAKE_VOLATILE_H were being set
	  twice (so, for instance, CS_UNIX_PLUGIN_REQUIRES_MAIN appeared twice
	  in the generated volatile.h).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed csLoader so that it no longer emits misleading
	  warning messages when one of the `optional' plugin is not loaded.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a memory leak in the DiskFile constructor in
	  vfs.cpp.  It was unnecessarily duplicating the `NameSuffix' argument
	  and then leaking the duplicate.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired several minor Texinfo mark-up problems in the
	  new emit.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine updated the formatting of all Apple/NeXT-related source
	  and header files to reflect the CS formatting guidelines.  This
	  change involved some very simple whitespace transformations.
	- Norman Kramer added non-const TYPE*& operator [] (int idx) to
	  csVector.
	- Philip Wyett added include "imesh/lighting.h" to bumptest.cpp.
	- Robert Bate updated Macintosh project files.
18-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a bug in the region checking code from the loader.
	- Renamed csCollider to csColliderWrapper and moved it from csengine
	  to cstool.
	- Moved csKeyValuePair from csengine to cstool. csMapNode is still
	  in csengine though. Renamed the include/source for csMapNode
	  from keyval.* to mapnode.*.
	- Also removed csEngine::CreateKey() and CreateKeyValuePair()
	  (similar for iEngine).
	- Added include/imesh/thing and moved all thing mesh object includes
	  from include/iengine to that dir (thing.h, polygon.h, lightmap.h,
	  polytmap.h, portal.h, ptextype.h, and curve.h).
	- Moved include/iengine/collider.h and polymesh.h to
	  include/ivaria.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a bug in iso engine clipping detection
	  (ClipBBox).
	- Wouter also fixed linux.mak. The 'make install' didn't work anymore
	  because a += was used where an = should be used (for SYSCONFIG).
	- Wouter fixed the ddraw.mak makefile so it no longer tries to install
	  the removed directx5 and 6 config files.
	- Worked on apimod19.txi.  Also updated dirhier.txi to add the sequence
	  plugin.
	- Philip Wyett fixed the video app after Jorrit's changes.
	- Michael Voasse shifted the tesselator from MetaBall to csgeom. It
	  is a general purpose utility that better serves CS in the geometry
	  library. Performance has been checked and a slight speedup has
	  been noticed in metagen, however, no significant improvement has
	  been observed in metaball.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired a problem with plugins/chapter.txi where it
	  was referencing plugins/anim/anim.txi even though that file does not
	  (yet) exist.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a slew of TeX `hbox' warnings from the
	  Texinfo documentation.
	- Eric Sunshine expanded several sections in apimod19.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine added a discussion of CS_IMPLEMENT_APPLICATION and
	  CS_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN to apimod19.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the new tesselator
	  facility in csGeom:
	    - Reworked the file comments so as to be Doxygen compatible.
	    - In order to avoid global namespace pollution, wrapped a class
	      named csTesselator around the bare structure name GridCell and
	      the bare function Tesselate().
	    - Removed ttables.h from CS/include/csgeom.  The information in
	      this file is merely an implementation detail of the tesselator
	      and didn't belong in a plubic include directory.  Moved the
	      contents of this file directly into tesselat.cpp since it merely
	      defines two static tables used by the implementation.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the MetaGen facility:
	    - Moved the EnvMappingModes type and the constants TRUE_ENV_MAP
	      and FAKE_ENV_MAP inside iMetaGen interface rather than allowing
	      them to pollute the global namespace.
	    - Fixed several bugs in metagen.mak, including one which caused it
	      to use the wrong commands when building the plugin module itself
	      (.so, .dll, etc.); and which consequently prevented the plugin
	      from building on some platforms (Mingw, NextStep, etc.).
	    - Fixed the module description in the makefile's DESCRIPTION
	      variable.
	- Eric Sunshine added class-level comments to csConfigFile and
	  csConfigManager so that Doxygen will emit documentation for these
	  classes.  (Doxygen ignores classes which have no class-level comment
	  even if the class is documented internally.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warning about csAnimatedPixmap
	  having virtual functions but non-virtual destructor following removal
	  of csBase.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed next2d.mak so that it correctly augments
	  CSFLAGS.INCLUDE when building with USE_PLUGINS=no.  This ensures that
	  the proper CFLAGS will be used even when the next2d driver is built
	  as a result of being a dependency of some other module (even when
	  not explicitly built via the next2d makefile target).
	- Eric Sunshine added the `static' qualifier to several stand-alone
	  functions in the MetaBall and MetaGen plugins in order to avoid
	  pollution of the gobal namespace.  Preventing this pollution allows
	  applications to link when USE_PLUGINS=no.  When the global namespace
	  was polluted, applications failed to link on account of multiply-
	  defined symbols (since both plugins implement at least one function
	  in common).
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning about signed versus
	  unsigned comparison in datastrm.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning about instance
	  members of csDataStream being initialized in an order different from
	  the declaration order.
	- Christopher Nelson made some changes to AWS:
	    - Made some minor changes, fixed some silly errors.
	    - Created the csComponentFactory class.
	    - Made some mods to the interface and manager to support
	      component registration.  
	- Norman Kramer removed csBase in favor of iBase (or in many cases it
	  is just removed).  Did various changes throughout the project for
	  this.
	- Norman als changed csObjVector so that it DecRef()'s the items in
	  FreeItem().
	- Norman made csLightArray descendant of iBase.
	- Norman changed scfSharedLibrary so it no longer derives from iBase.
	- Norman changed csRect so it no longer derives from iBase.
	- Norman moved pulse and meter from csengine to csutil.
17-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a bug in 'facedown'/'faceup' commands (walktest). Reported
	  by Thiago Ramon.
	- Did a very trivial optimizaton. It appeared that a lot of code
	  on curve drawing setup was done every frame for every thing
	  that is drawn. This code is totally unneeded in most cases
	  (except if there really is a curve).
	- Renamed csfx to cstool. This is to prepare for addition
	  of additional features which are not really special
	  effects.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem with the rlecodec makefile where the
	  SCF.STATIC was given an incorrect value.  This caused linking to fail
	  when USE_PLUGINS was set to `no'.
	- Christopher Nelson made a small algorithmic change to the dirty
	  rect update scheme.  It's a little less silly about what to do
	  when all the buckets fill up:  it sets a flag \, merges all
	  previous rects into bucket zero, and then uses bucket zero for all
	  subsequent updates.  This eliminates overdraw in the sinplest way,
	  without making the algorithm overly complex.
	- Michael Voasse added a new metagen mesh object plugin.
	- Martin Geisse applied some major changes to the initial model
	  converter interface:
	    - All model data components now implement iObject
	    - Removed lists of sub-objects from all objects (e.g. the list
	      of polygons from mesh objects). Sub-objects should be added
	      as iObject children.
	    - Vertex positions are no longer stored per-vertex. Instead, all
	      vertices in a solid object are kept in one big list and
	      polygons use indices in this list.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a warning in metagen (struct vs class).
	- Philip also fixed the tutorial makefiles with regards to csfx
	  vs cstool. Jorrit forgot to fix those. Philip also fixed a bad
	  include in cstool itself.
	- Norman Kramer added call to PrepareAnim() to bumptest.cpp.
	- Norman Kramer renamed the following methods throughout the entire
	  project:
	    GetMiniBspNumVerts  -->  GetMiniBspVertexCount
	    GetNumActions  -->  GetActionCount
	    GetNumChars  -->  GetCharCount

16-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a bad bug in iPolygon3D::CreateNullPortal(). This function
	  should be used to create portals that point nowhere yet. A
	  callback associated with that portal will be called whenever
	  the engine needs to go through the portal. This function did not
	  work correctly though. It would set garbage to the sector pointer
	  instead of a valid NULL pointer.
	- Fixed a bug in the map loader when used in combination with
	  regions. It would actually start resolving sector portals again,
	  even from sectors not loaded in this region.
	- Martin Geisse made the following changes:
	    - Added first, incomplete version of the converter system.
	    - Added csDataStream, a utility class that takes a buffer of
	      data and lets it use as a stream.
	    - Added a macro that lets you define a 'pool' class. This pool
	      can be used to store unused objects instead of deleting them.
	      When you need an object of the same class again, the pool gives
	      the object back.
	- Philip Wyett added VFS paths for Red Eye Entertainments current
	  4 CS technical demo levels. As the levels are worked on and tested
	  daily, it is much easier for these to be in CVS, I hope nobody
	  minds? I will remove if someone complains or there is general
	  objection...
	- Christopher Nelson did the following (to AWS):
	    - Updated AWS interface to allow Mark().
	    - Created the Mark routine in the window manager using simple
	      scatter/gather techniques to make more efficient use of bandwidth
	      for updates which have many small regions.
	    - Created Invalidate, which calls Mark with the frame of the
	      compent's area to be marked.
	    - Created signal and slot architecture.  Slots are signal
	      conduits that end at a sink.  Slots are currently component to
	      component conduits.  A signal is emitted by calling Emit
	      with a reference to the emitting component and an unsigned long
	      that represents the signal. A sink is always a component member
	      function.  I realize that that is a silly restriction, so I
	      will modify that to allow any class that sub-classes a new
	      class called awsSink to be a signal sink.  Components will then
	      inherit from this class.
	    - Cleaned up some code involving drawing contexts. The drawing
	      contexts are now stored in the window manager, and referenced
	      by components from there.  Two new functions SetContext and
	      SetDefaultContext can be called to setup these contexts.  One
	      or the other MUST be called.  SetDefaultContext sets the
	      contexts to an internal procedural texture.  The user
	      can get the iTextureHandle of this (though I don't currently
	      have it exposed.)
	    - I would caution anyone who modifies sllex.cpp to be aware that
	      this file, and it's associate slparse.cpp are both automatically
	      generated.  Any changes you make will disappear if there are any
	      modifications to skinlang.flx or skinlang.bsn.  If possible, it
	      would be better to fix problems in the soure parser and lex
	      language files rather than their generated results.
	    - Modified the slot/signal system to support a special type called
	      iAwsSigSrc as signal sources.  Signal sources have some
	      special helper functions for registering and unregistering
	      slots, as well as broadcasting to the lot of them.
	    - Slot sinks can now be any member function of a class derived
	      from iBase. This should make the system much more general and
	      useful.
	    - For now signal is an unsigned long, but I have run into the
	      question of how to figure out who a signal source really is,
	      and how to get the changed value from them.  Originally I
	      wanted to have all signal sources simply be components, but
	      that limits the system somewhat. For example, what if i want
	      the WindowManger to be a signal source? Or the preferences
	      manager?  I may move the ID functionality from components to
	      iAwsSigSrc classes so that you can ask the window manager just
	      exactly who and what the signal source is.  I thought about
	      using the SCF system, but that's a little too heavyweight for
	      what I want to do.
	      I think that mostly the signal should identify the type of
	      source, for example, push buttons and radio buttons would have
	      different signals for a mouse click.  However, this introduces
	      the problem of namespace collision.  Perhaps signals should be
	      registered in a signal source and mapped to an unsigned long
	      like ID's.  Then signals themselves can be referenced by index,
	      much like the colors for csws components.
		e.g. 
		#define PB_MOUSEDOWN 1
		signals[PB_MOUSEDOWN] = NameToID("pushbutton_mousedown");
	      The signal itself would still have to be sent using the real
	      value.  This would mess up switch statements, though, because
	      you'd never know ahead of time what the values would be.
	      They wouldn't be.  Hm... const.  
	    - Fixed small compile bug introduced by my incorrect handling
	      of the RCS merge of different versions.
15-Jun-2001
	- Added the ability to the parser to load proc textures (fire,
	  water, dots, and plasma). Instead of saying 'TEXTURE' in the
	  textures block of the world file you can say 'PROCTEX'. Check
	  out data/flarge/world for an example (in the large hall there
	  is a rotating cube with all the proc textures on).
	- Added 'FLARE' type to the possible NOVA types in the loader
	  (in addition to 'NOVA' and 'CROSS'). Added an example of
	  this in flarge (go to the street).
	- Updated the first part of the simple tutorial so that it works
	  again with latest CVS. Also brought back simple to the tutorial
	  state (i.e. removed halos and proc textures).
	- Also added a transparent floating sphere which has the plasma
	  proc texture on it (in flarge).
	- Fixed a bug in the procedural textures. They tried to initialize
	  themselves too early, even before the Prepare() of the texture-
	  manager happened.
	- Removed simple app. Instead added new 'tutor' dir which will
	  contains sub-dirs for all tutorial sections in the manual.
	  Currently there are two simple tutorials so there are also
	  two simple directories in 'tutor'. The targets are 'tutsimp'
	  and 'tutsimp2'.
	- Wouter Wijngaards writes: the clipping of mesh objects should now
	  be correctly handled in the iso engine.
	- Renamed widht2/height2 to asp_center_x/y in OpenGL renderer.
	  This is really the center of the perspective aspect and not
	  just width or height divided by two. Fixed a related bug in the
	  edge drawing which would not work correctly with iso engine for
	  this reason.
	- Added 'simpmap' tutorial app. This app is not yet in the tutorials
	  because it doesn't work yet. I have to investigate why it is
	  crashing.
	- Seems like simpmap is working after all.  I only had to recompile the
	  engine plugin :-)
	- Added a new simple tutorial to the documentation.  Now there are
	  three chapters.
	- Philip Wyett fixed other sub makefiles in an attempt
	  to find why MSVCGEN process cannot parse the apps/tutor dir.
	- Philip Wyett changed to remove sub of apps to a wildcard "*"
	  for msvcxgen process rather than "tests" which was before. Now can
	  generate any "app/../../" projects with msvcgen process.
	- Philip Wyett extended previous commit by changing "TESTS_SUBMAKEFILES"
	  to "SUBAPPLICATION_SUBMAKEFILES" as now it is searching both
	  "apps/tutor/*" as well as the old "apps/tests/*".
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated the new SUBAPPLICATION_SUBMAKEFILES variable
	  from subs.mak and replaced it with TESTS_SUBMAKEFILES and
	  TUTORIAL_SUBMAKEFILES.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed apps/tutor to apps/tutorial.  Also renamed the
	  `simple' tutorial to `simple1' to complement the `simple2' tutorial.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip's changes to gfxtest.mak, vfstest.mak,
	  and g2dtest.mak.  Most of the changes were unnecessary, but in a few
	  cases they were also undesirable.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip's change to sllex.cpp because it broke
	  compilation on all platforms other than Visual-C++.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning about member
	  initialization occurring in wrong order in keyval.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a bogus error in the NextStep compiler
	  where it claimed to know nothing about the embedded ~awsCanvas() in
	  the awsmgr.cpp file.
	- Eric Sunshine added the missing `aws' entry to the PLUGINS.DYNAMIC
	  list in user.mak.  (Currently commented-out, though).
	- Christopher Nelson did lots of changes to AWS:
	    - Implemented most of awsWindow's basic functionality. Windows
	      are arranged in a doubly-linked list hierarchy. The top window
	      is pointed to by the window manager, and the hierachy follows
	      downwards from there. awsWindow implements Raise() and Lower(),
	      and implements two new triggers, OnRaise() and OnLower().  
	    - Expanded awsComponent. Implemented default Setup() function to
	      automatically pull the frame and id of a component out of the
	      component's setup information gleaned from the defintion file.
	      Also setup the default triggers like OnMouse*() and OnKeypress().
	    - Fixed makefile to include CSGFX and CSFX.
	    - Expanded awsManager to include tracking of a top window. Also
	      embedded a subclass of csProcTexture in it to allow components
	      to draw to this canvas.  The manager actually uses the
	      user-provided iGraphics3D to draw the window manager's canvas
	      to the screen.  I may also allow the user to specify a virtual
	      screen size and a texture size, and then perform drawing over
	      NxN textures based on the virtual screen and rect tests.
	- Philip Wyett fixed sllex.cpp so will compile on MSVC.
	  This fix has been tested on MSVC, MingW (GCC)
	  and the GCC 2.96 from Linux Mandrake 8 and
	  works fine. This all could be altered at a later date
	  when the plugin becomes active, but for testing
	  purposes on MSVC it is adequate.
14-Jun-2001
	- Made the terrain visibility checker more efficient and more robust.
	  The calculation of the extent works completely different now and
	  first calculates the left/right indices of the bounding box.  Then it
	  will compute the angles only of those two vertices instead of all
	  four vertices.  This speeds up vis testing a little.  Unfortunatelly
	  it doesn't solve a bug which seems to cull away terrain blocks
	  wrongly.
	- Added csBox2::SquaredOriginDist() similar to the already existing
	  csBox3 version.
	- Added csBox2/3::SquaredOriginMaxDist() which returnes the maximum
	  squared distance instead of the minimum one.
	- Using the above functions added another optimization to the
	  terrain visibility checker. Again this does not solve the bug though.
	- Fixed the bug in the visibility checker. The minimum and maximum
	  heights were correctly calculated but not scaled and translated
	  according to the parameters given by the terrfunc user.
	- Set default quad-tree depth to 6 instead of 4. This seems to give
	  much better results for newsky.zip.
	- Did a VERY small optimization to the octree traversal code with
	  regards to selecting front2back/back2front modes.
	- BugPlug will now also work for apps that don't have a font
	  server. But a lot of functionality will not work.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated all of the special platform-specific glue
	  libraries and objects with which applications and plugin were
	  required to link in the past.  Rather than maintaining special object
	  files and static libraries, the platform-specific glue is now
	  implemented on-the-fly via macros.
	    - Eliminated all of the platform-specific special implementation
	      files:
		cssys/os2/dllentry.cpp
		cssys/ps2/dummy.cpp
		cssys/unix/dummy.cpp
		cssys/win32/dllentry.cpp
		cssys/win32/exeentry.cpp
	    - Removed the Windows-specific special static link libraries along
	      with their project files:
		cswin32exe.lib
		cswin32dll.lib
		libcswin32exe.dsp
		libcswin32dll.dsp
	    - Eliminated the MSVC dependencies upon libcswin32exe.dsp and
	      libcswin32dll.dsp.
	    - Eliminated the SRC.SYS_CSSYS_EXE and SRC.SYS_CSSYS_DLL
	      system-level makefile variables which controlled how the special
	      implementation files were inserted into the build process.
	    - Added the new macro CS_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN to cssysdef.h.  This
	      macro should be placed at the global scope in exactly one
	      compilation unit comprising a plugin module.  For maximum
	      portability, each plugin module must employ this macro.  Some
	      platforms override the definition of this macro in order to
	      augment the implementation of the plugin module with any special
	      implementation details required by the platform.  For example,
	      the Windows port uses this macro to implement the DllMain()
	      function.
	    - Added the new macro CS_IMPLEMENT_APPLICATION to cssysdef.h.  This
	      macro should be placed at the global scope in exactly one
	      compilation unit comprising an application.  For maximum
	      portability, each application should employ this macro.
	      Platforms override the definition of this macro in order to
	      augment the implementation of an application with any special
	      implementation details required by the platform.  For example,
	      the Windows port uses this macro to implement the WinMain()
	      function.
	    - cssysdef.h for OS/2 now defines CS_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN to implement
	      _DLL_InitTerm() and a version of getenv() which works for plugin
	      modules.
	    - cssysdef.h for Unix now defines CS_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN to implement
	      main() in plugin modules if requested by the platform-specific
	      makefile.  Currently, the Linux, FreeBSD, and Hurd makefiles
	      request this augmentation.
	    - cssysdef.h for Windows now defines CS_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN to
	      implement DllMain(), and CS_IMPLEMENT_APPLICATION to define
	      WinMain().
	    - Completely re-worked and simplified the convoluted `main' versus
	      `csMain' versus `WinMain' issue on Windows.  In the past, the
	      Windows port tried renaming all `main' functions to `csMain' (via
	      the C-preprocessor), and then implemented its own `main' and
	      `WinMain' functions which acted as covers to `csMain'.  With the
	      new, much simpler scheme, `WinMain' is merely a thin cover over
	      `main' and global renaming is unnecessary.
	    - Augmented all applications and plugin modules with the new
	      CS_IMPLEMENT_APPLICATION and CS_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN macros.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a missing bracket in DECLARE_TYPED_SCF_VECTOR.
	- Philip Wyett fixed some includes in aws plugin:
	  Fixed #includes so only GCC compilers use
	  "unistd.h" and MSVC 5/6 use "io.h"
	- Philip removed zlib png and jpeg libs from MSVC projects files and
	  placed in the makefiles for apps or plugins in which they are
	  required.
	- Eric Sunshine added a makefile debugging facility which allows the
	  user to easily view the expansion of any makefile variable.  To use,
	  invoke the makefile target `show' and set the makefile variable `V'
	  to the name of the variable of interest.  For instance, to display
	  the expansion of $(SRC.SOFT3D), invoke "make show V=SRC.SOFT3D".
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a couple compilation warnings reported by
	  MSVC in 3dsload.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the `drivers' makefile target so that it also
	  builds the Socket network driver.
	- Martin Geisse did the following:
	    - Cleaned up the code for csPortal, csKeyValuePair and csMapNode.
	    - Added several csPortal methods to iPortal.
	    - Renamed iPortal::GetPortal / SetPortal to GetSector and
	      SetSector.
	    - Added the missing SetKey to iKeyValuePair.
	    - Removed the unused 'MyOwner' member of csMeshWrapper.
	    - Added some missing const specifiers to methods of csFlags.
	- Martin also added dummy files for the model import/export,
	  crossbuilder and sprite/thing impexp loader plug-ins. The plugins
	  are still work in progress, and the dummy files are there to make
	  the makefiles work.
	- Philip Wyett added makefiles for the new impexp plugins (thingie,
	  spr3die, povie, crossbld, and multiplex.
	- Philip also added a fix from Jason Moyers which changes return
	  'false' to return 'NULL' (in libs/csparser).
	- Christopher Nelson updated interface definitions for aws.
	- Christopher also added useful querying classes to the preference
	  manager to select a current skin, and to be able to get values from
	  the skin tree. Also added NameToId mapping function.  Added some
	  more items to the interface definition files.
13-Jun-2001
	- Increased robustness of the Spider in BugPlug a little. If there
	  are no sectors it will not start hunting. There is also a timeout
	  of 20 frames. If the camera has not been found in that time then
	  the hunt will be canceled.
	- Added the ability to do mouse selection in BugPlug.
	- Added a small patch from Alistair Leslie <AlistairL@optushome.com.au>
	  to make sure that the impexp importer doesn't crash when it cannot
	  write to ivcon.log. In that case it will write to standard
	  output.
	- Discovered an obsolete ddg.h include. Removed it.
	- Thanks to Wouter we finished visibility testing for the terrain
	  engine.
	- Extended the iTerrFuncState interface to enable/disable this
	  visibility testing (enabled by default).
	- Also added VISTEST keyword to the terrain loader plugin.
	- Added new command in BugPlug to enable/disable terrain visibility.
	- Martin Geisse added a 'const' version of 'operator []' to
	  DECLARE_GROWING_ARRAY.
	- Martin removed an include of ddg.h.
	- Philip Wyett removed unused libs from MSVC project files.
	  Moved ddraw and other libs to makefiles where it is required.
	  A work in progress...
	- Fixed SCF_TRACE for embedded SCF interfaces. scfRefCount is
	  no longer part of the embedded interface.
	- Martin Geisse added DECLARE_TYPED_SCF_VECTOR again (a version of
	  typed vectors that controls the reference count of the contained
	  objects). This time it should work correctly.
	- Christopher Nelson did more work on the parser, as well as some
	  additional work on the preferences manager. The parser now adds
	  window and skin definition trees into the preference manager. (In
	  other words, the parser is now useful. :-)
	  There is a difference between skin and window definitions that may
	  not seem obvious at first.  That is, skin definitions specify
	  global options for components and window defintions specify local,
	  unique options.  In other words, the background texture for all
	  items would be specified in a skin definition.  As would the
	  texture used for buttons, for checkboxes, scrollbars, etc.  A
	  window definition is used to specify stuff like the caption, where
	  the component goes, exactly what type of window it is, etc.
	  Window definitions currently take a skin definition as a parameter
	  of their grammatical structure.  I'm not sure this is a good idea,
	  and I will probably change that.  Multiple skin definitions and
	  window definitions can exist in a single file.  There is no need to
	  predeclare anything, since there are no interdependencies.  I may
	  add an include statement which will allow a single file to include
	  other files that it may depend upon.
	  I am thinking through the ramifications of allowing modular code, e.g.
		component "Sex Frame" is "Frame"
		{
		  component "Male" is "Radio Button"
		  { ... }
		  component "Female is "Radio Button"
		  { ... }
		}
	  then later:
		window "new player"
		{
		  named component "Sex Frame"
		}
	  This may make some things a lot easier, especially when you have
	  gui constructs that you'd like to use in other places.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a bug in the texture manager: materials are
	  freed now. Also fixed this in the software renderer.
	- Norman also added Clear to OpenGL similar to softrenderer, now
	  bumptest wont crash at exit but still leaves unreleased instances
	  when using opengl renderer.
12-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a compile error and warning in SCF.
	- Removed dumper.cpp and dumper.h. They are obsolete and BugPlug
	  will soon get nearly all the functionality which was in Dumper.
	- Removed obsolete (and useless) unix specific signal handling
	  in walktest.cpp.
	- Removed the commands 'gamma', 'dblbuff', 'dump', 'coorddump',
	  'fov', and 'fovangle' from WalkTest. Extended BugPlug to have
	  the equivalent functionality.
	- Added the ability to open an edit line (to enter text) in
	  BugPlug. This works but unfortunatelly the display flickers.
	  I'm not sure how to avoid that.
	- Beware! In the dark recesses of BugPlug there now lives a creature
	  so awful and fierce that even the mightiest heroes don't dare to
	  look at it! When the sun shines over the mountains and fields,
	  everything is well and Spider remains hidden in its dark cave.
	  However, when the moonlight is dim or shaded, and nasty bugs crawl
	  over the country, Spider will weave its web of deceit over the
	  infected land! Unaware of the great danger, an unsuspecting wanderer
	  might look over the country. Here Spider will strike! It will put
	  a curse on the wanderer which will reveal his whereabouts to Spider
	  at any time in the future! The only remedy to this curse is death!
	- Fixed a bug with BugPlug. It will now work correctly together with
	  Iso engine and other applications that don't use the 3D engine.
	  Previously it assumed there always was an iEngine. Now it just
	  disables all functionality that has to do with iEngine (like the
	  Spider). All other functionality will work though.
	- Fixed some documentation with regards to recent changes.
	- Fixed a bug in a CS_ASSERT in spider.
	- Eric Sunshine applied a more correct fix to SCF following Jorrit's
	  patch today.  DECLARE_FAST_INTERFACE() now correctly employs the
	  opaque scfInterfaceID rather than uint32.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the now obsolete DO_COREDUMP makefile variable.
	- Martin Geisse did the following:
	    - Some cleanup of csparser: Renamed some functions that
	      involve parsing to Parse??? (example: load_vector to
	      ParseVector). The goal of this is to make a clear difference
	      between functions that load data from files and functions that
	      interpret parts of the world file. Also changes usage of
	      fatal_exit() to returning 'false' in some cases.
	    - Continued work on csparser (renaming functions and removing
	      fatal_exit). To make the code more readable, I added a function
	      to handle the error output for unknown tokens (as all those
	      error messages were up to 3 lines of identical code except one
	      word). Also added a convenience method to csObject that adds
	      all child objects of another object as children. Using this
	      method I fixed the bug that allowed static lights to have
	      only one key-value pair attached to them.
	- Christopher Nelson made some more progress on the parser. 
	  Implemented the very helpful patches sent to me by Eric Sunshine,
	  so the test harness now functions properly with the plugin.
	  The parser now recognizes complete skin definitions, and constructs
	  a proper parse tree of the results, though it currently discards
	  the results at the top level.
	- Christopher reports:
	  Lots more work on the parser. The parse tree is nearly completely
	  constructed, only discarded at the very top layer. The parser can
	  currently properly parse the following definition:
		skin "Normal Window"
		{
  		  Texture: "/lib/windows/texture.png"
		  Another: "/lib/tex/windows/defbackgr.png"
		  Wack:  "/libandstuff/dir/garbage.png"
		}
		window "New User" from "Normal Window"
		{
		  Frame: (100, 200) - (400, 500)
		  Style: Bitmapped
		  Overlay: "/lib/windows/newuserovl.png"
		  Back:    "/lib/windows/newuserbck.png"
  		  component "User Name" is "Textbox"
		  {
		    Frame: (10, 30) - (390, 45)
		    Style: NoFrame
		    Caption: "Name:"
		  }
		  ...
	  Components can be nested as deeply as you want. So far I'm assuming
	  that coordinates of children are expressed inside their parent's
	  rectangle. Any integers that occur can be normal infix expressions
	  using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
	  (parenthetical solving is, of course, included).  I don't expect
	  you to need more than that, but if you do let me know.
	  I'm vaguely thinking of adding some sort of macro variable system
	  where you can assign certain variables a value, and then use those
	  values later down as offsets. As in:
		define FirstRadFrame = (10,10) - (100,35)
		component "bla" is "Radio Button"
		{
		  Frame: (FirstRadFrame.Left, FirstRadFrame.Top+15)
		  	- (FirstRadFrame.Right, FirstRadFrame.Bottom+15)
		}
	- Justin Miller fixed a bug in OpenGL renderer so that resize
	  of window should work correctly. I have been told however that
	  it is still not working completely ok.
11-Jun-2001
	- Created a new 'bugplug' plugin. This plugin will give debugging
	  functionality to any CS app. To use it just add the following
	  line to your config:
		System.PlugIns.BugPlug = crystalspace.utilities.bugplug
	  or load the plugin from the code with:
		LOAD_PLUGIN (System, "crystalspace.utilities.bugplug",
			"BugPlug", iPlugIn);
	  That's all you have to do. The plugin will nest itself in the
	  application event loop and listens to keys. In
	  data/config/bugplug.cfg you can control to what keys it listens.
	  The most important key is assigned to the 'debugenter' key.
	  When this key is pressed (by default it is ctrl-d) the next key
	  will be given to BugPlug which will perform the associated
	  command. The other keys and commands are also defined in
	  bugplug.cfg.
	- Added 'bugplug' to the WalkTest config file (commented) and also
	  added new 'bugplug' console command. The best way to get
	  BugPlug working in all your apps automatically is to add the
	  following line to data/config/user.cfg:
		Global.System.PlugIns.BugPlug = crystalspace.utilities.bugplug
	- Removed 'edges', 'cacheclear', 'cachedump', 'texture', 'lighting',
	  'bilinear', 'trilinear', 'ilace', 'mmx', 'gouraud', 'transp',
	  'mipmap', 'inter', and 'fclear' debug commands from walktest
	  since BugPlug can do those now.
	- Fixed a crash at exit bug in OpenGL renderer.
	- Extended csObject with an optional 'parent' object (NULL by default).
	  This can be used to create csObject's with another SCF parent.
	- csThing now sets up the SCF parent chain. This is to try to make sure
	  that csThing will now implement iFactory indirectly. Unfortunatelly
	  it still doesn't work.
	- Gregory Austwick (g.austwick@virgin.net) contributed a few patches
	  to CS: fix for dungeon plugin, fix for standard output console,
	  fix for DDraw canvas and a fix in the DirectDetection code
	  for Windows.
	- Moved all csObject stuff from csObject library to csUtil library.
	  This means that the csObject library is now gone.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a Doxygen warning from clip2d.h.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the unused and broken borland.mak.  If someone
	  wants to revive this in the future, it can be resurrected from the
	  CVS Attic.
	- Eric Sunshine corrected the makefile DESCRIPTION variables for the
	  MetaBalls plugins.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes:
	    - Moved the contents of plugins/engine to plugins/engine/3d.
	    - Moved plugins/iso to plugins/engine/iso.
	- Eric Sunshine re-organized the plugins/mesh directory.  Whereas, in
	  the past, components for a single type of mesh were spread across
	  multiple locations in the mesh directory hierarchy, now each mesh
	  type is self-contained.  For example, in the past, we had:
	    plugins/mesh/object/ball
	    plugins/mesh/load/ball
	  We now have:
	    plugins/mesh/ball/object
	    plugins/mesh/ball/persist/classic
	  The `persist' directory contains plugins which manage object
	  persistence (such as loading and saving to files).  The `classic'
	  subdirectory contains code to manage persistence for the so-called
	  classic CS file format.  Other theoretical future subdirectories
	  might include (among others):
	    plugins/mesh/ball/persist/xml
	    plugins/mesh/ball/persist/binary
	- Eric Sunshine renamed plugins/colldet to plugins/collide.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed the SCF class name for the Rapid plugin from
	  crystalspace.colldet.rapid to crystalspace.collisiondetection.rapid.
	- Eric Sunshine re-organized the plugins/motion directory hierarchy to
	  resemble the new plugins/mesh directory organization.  Instead of
	  these directories:
	    plugins/motion/object/default
	    plugins/motion/loader/default
	  We now have:
	    plugins/motion/standard/object
	    plugins/motion/standard/persist/classic
	- Eric Sunshine re-organized the plugins/terrain directory hierarchy to
	  resemble the new plugins/mesh directory organization.  Instead of
	  these directories:
	    plugins/terrain/object/terrfunc
	    plugins/terrain/loader/terrfunc
	  We now have:
	    plugins/terrain/function/object
	    plugins/terrain/function/persist/classic
	- Eric Sunshine modified the `msvcgen' template files so that they now
	  define CS_DEBUG when building in debug mode in order to be consistent
	  with the Unix build process.
	- Eric Sunshine modified msvcgen.mak so that it now disables makefile
	  NASM flags, thus preventing NASM assembly files from appearing in
	  generated DSP files even if the environment which is generating the
	  DSP files has NASM enabled.
	- Fixed a bug with G3DRENDERSTATE_INTERLACINGENABLE and software
	  renderer. The setting was not correctly processed.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in walkcmd.cpp
	  regarding "computed value not used."
	- Eric Sunshine re-introduced some extra searching-logic into
	  csFindLoadLibrary in NeXTDynamicLibrary.cpp so that scfreg can once
	  again find plugin modules which are stored in the "components"
	  subdirectory of the current directory.
	- Martin Geisse changed the way the ID numbers for
	  QUERY_INTERFACE_FAST are stored. There is now an inline wrapper
	  function around each ID variable, DECLARE_FAST_INTERFACE.
	  This has two advantages: Firstly, it requires much less code (just
	  one macro per interface compared to three). Secondly, as inline
	  functions are local to their compilation unit, there are no more
	  problems with duplicate symbols (as it was the case with global
	  variables).
	- Martin Geisse changed the incorrect usage of IMPLEMENT_IBASE to
	  IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT in two cases.
	- Robert Bate updated the Mac project files for the new BugPlug
	  plugin and also updated all project files to the new directory
	  structure and added targets for emit, metaball, and stars mesh
	  objects.
	- Robert also did a fix to the emit particle system for the picky
	  CodeWarrior compiler.
	- Christopher Nelson added interface includes for AWS in ivaria.
	- Christopher also made some modifications to AWS so that it can be
	  a plugin. Still doesn't load properly.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to AWS:
	    - Fixed up the SCF goop so that the plugin loads properly and
	      registers all of its plublic classes.  In particular, added
	      registration for the awsPrefManager class.  Also added a missing
	      IMPLEMENT_FACTORY() for this class.
	    - Replaced use of static_cast<> with STATIC_CAST() for better
	      portability.
	    - Removed the `i' prefix from the names of the AWS files in
	      CS/include/ivaria and merged them into aws.h.
	    - Repaired a couple minor makefile defects.
	- Norman Kramer fixed g2dtest so that it works again. To fix this he
	  made the G2D variable in csSystemDriver protected. This is a
	  temporary solution.
	- Norman also fixed some include paths in some of the files of
	  the 3D sprite mesh plugin.
10-Jun-2001
	- Norman Kramer did the following:
	    - Blocks now decrefs its queried soundwrapper, releases/stops the
	      background sound and decrefs the loaded font ... this all
	      results in blocks not leaving any unreleased instances at exit
	      anymore.
	    - csEngine::Clear now releases all collected objects via
	      ObjRemoveAll (this will assure for instance soundwrappers are
	      decref'd correctly).
	    - DecRef'ed the created proc_image (think there must be a Ref
	      bug in the software procedural texture interface - boy do I
	      hate that).
	    - Made iSoundHandle::Play return a soundsource for looping sounds.
	    - Soundsources parent is the originating soundhandle instead of
	      soundrender: this prevents circular dependency with
	      IncRef/DecRef.
	- Michael Voasse did the following:
	    - Normalized metaball default rendering area to be symmetrical
	      on all axes.
	    - The metaballs should now render around (0,0,0) where you place
	      them rather than at (0,0,10).
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed his latest fix to terrvis.
9-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a bug in csRenderView::ClipBBox() with regards to clipping
	  to the near plane in combination with mirroring. This would
	  result in meshes not being culled away when seen through a mirror
	  when they should have been culled away.
	- Fixed a crash in terrain engine where dx/dy for the height
	  function would go slightly out of bounds.
	- Norman Kramer added missing engine->DecRef() in csView.
	- Norman did: interface id has been requested for every plugin loaded
	  when querying an interface.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did a few fixes to terrain visibility:
	    - Fixed a bug where the terrainvis front to back was not
	      working. Need to XOR, not add to the camchild.
	    - Fixed GetHorIndex() routine, now the angle-indices are arranged
	      so that idx=0 and idx=horsize/2 have the x-axis running through
	      their middle. So z<0 or z>0 will not make much of a difference
	      anymore in these cases.
8-Jun-2001
	- Added iMeshObjectType::GetFeatures(), also added iMeshObject
	  GetLODFeatures(), SetLODFeatures(), GetLOD(), SetLOD(), and
	  GetLODPolygonCount(). These are all functions that have to do
	  with LOD (both on polygon count and enabling/disabling features).
	  In the future we'll be able to make a LOD manager in the engine
	  using these new calls.
	- Extended all existing mesh objects with these new features. Note
	  that the implementations are empty at the moment. The calls
	  will work but don't do anything useful yet.
	- Did a fundamental change in how the engine manages mesh wrappers.
	  engine::CreateMeshObject() used to make a new mesh wrapper and
	  then call IncRef() on it (resulting in a ref-count of 2). The
	  explicit IncRef() is removed (the engine only has one ref to the
	  mesh wrapper and not two). In addition engine::UnlinkMesh() is
	  removed. Instead you have to use engine::RemoveMesh(). If you
	  want to keep a mesh (but still want to remove it from the engine)
	  you should make sure you did IncRef() on the mesh as well.
	- Also modified engine::NextFrame() to call RemoveMesh(). This
	  means the mesh will be unlinked from the engine and all sectors
	  and also removed IF the engine was the only one with a reference
	  to that mesh.
	- Added iEngine::RemoveMesh().
	- Also removed engine::UnlinkTerrain() and added
	  iEngine::RemoveTerrain(). Also removed the additional IncRef() that
	  was happening in CreateTerrainObject().
	- Removed the non-const version of csMeshWrapper::GetChildren().
	  This is no longer safe to use. The method AddChild() take care of
	  correctly managing ref counts.
	- Added iMeshWrapper::RemoveChild() to remove a child in a
	  hierarchical mesh setup.
	- Added iMeshWrapper::GetParentContainer() to get the parent
	  (either iEngine or iMeshWrapper) from a mesh wrapper.
	- Added clip_z_plane to G3DTriangleMesh. Clipping to the z-plane
	  or to the (optional) near plane should be considered seperate.
	  It is possible for an object to go beyond both planes independently.
	- Extended csRenderView/iRenderView::ClipBBox() with a new
	  clip_z_plane parameter.
	- Fixed all mesh plugins to correctly fill the triangle mesh
	  with the new clip_z_plane parameter from ClipBBox().
	- The OpenGL renderer will now correctly look at the new clip_z_plane
	  flag and handle it accordingly. The software renderer still ignores
	  plane clipping though.
	- Fixed a bug in OpenGL edge drawing. It was not disabling GL_BLEND
	  before drawing the line.
	- The OpenGL renderer will now always clip geometry to the z=0
	  plane if needed (for DrawTriangleMesh). It appears that with this
	  feature the need for screen clipping is no longer there. The
	  flag is still in opengl.cfg though in case it IS still needed
	  but it may be that everything is ok now.
	- Fixed an EXTREMELY stupid bug in OpenGL renderer which caused
	  all polygons to be rendered twice :-)
	- Added callback functionality to iRenderView (copy from csRenderView).
	  Reduce the number of callbacks to 4: CALLBACK_SECTOR,
	  CALLBACK_SECTOREXIT, CALLBACK_MESH, and CALLBACK_VISMESH.
	  iEngine::DrawFunc() is now working again but will no longer fire
	  callbacks for every individual polygon. It will stop at the
	  mesh level.
	- Removed 'frustum' command from WalkTest. It was never very useful
	  and was broken anyway.
	- Removed 'dumpvis' command from WalkTest. It was also broken.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the prototype of iSCF::QueryClassList() so that
	  it now returns matches via an iStrVector object rather than a (char
	  const**) which was free()'d by the caller.  It was necessary to
	  return a reference-counted object in order to avoid the problem of
	  allocating memory from one heap (the application's) and freeing it
	  into another (a plugin's, for instance).  I am not terribly happy
	  about using an SCF interface (iStrVector) in the declaration of the
	  core SCF since it introduces a sort of circular dependency, however
	  SCF was already polluted in this fashion by use of iConfigFile.  In
	  the future, in order to address this chicken-and-egg problem, I think
	  that we should eliminate both iConfigFile and iStrVector from the
	  core scf.h interface.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired an outdated reference to the metaball plugin
	  in metaball.cfg which prevented the plugin from loading.
	- Eric Sunshine removed an out-of-date reference to the old MetaBall
	  plugin from user.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a crasher in the metaball plugin which he
	  introduced the day before.  Also made the G3DTriangleMesh a simple
	  instance variable of csMetaBall rather than specially allocating it
	  from the heap.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the binary meta.zip file from CVS and re-added
	  the `world' as a simple text file in CS/data/metaball/world.  Updated
	  vfs.cfg to point at this new location.
	- Robert Bate did updates to the Mac port again:
	    - Codewarrior is very picky with the floating point constants
	      passed to templated routines.  Making sure they all are floats.
	    - Enhanced carbon compatibility.
	    - Updated all Mac project files.
	    - Cleaned up the 2d driver code for OpenGL.
	    - Added the Mac to the extension detection code.
	- Norman Kramer changed format directives in scf.cfg.
	- Norman also fixed the iso engine after Jorrit broke it (missing
	  Callback related methods in iRenderView implementation of iso
	  engine).
7-Jun-2001
	- Justin Miller fixed a minor syntax error in csview.h.
	- Wouter Wijngaards gave the start to implementing a visibility
	  system for the terrfunc terrain engine and I tried to finish
	  it but things are not yet working. So at the moment it is
	  still disabled.
	- Fixed a bad bug in the bsp traversal code with regards to object
	  visibility testing. In the Front2Back code the bounding box polygons
	  have to be traversed BEFORE the real polygons because they
	  really are in front of the polygons of the node itself. When
	  bounding box polygons are inserted in a bsp tree they will not
	  cause bsp leafs to be split further. So perfect sorting is not
	  guaranteed. Normally this does not matter as this is only used
	  for visibility testing but we have to make sure that at least
	  the real polygons are traversed after the bounding box polygons
	  because the real polygons update the c-buffer and the bounding
	  box polygons test against it.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the new meta.cpp so that it compiles on NextStep.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed CS_ASSERT. It had a printf of the assertion,
	  printf("..." #x ), but if the assertion contains % signs, (perhaps
	  even %s!), this could give serious problems. Changed to
	  printf(".... %s", .., #x).
	- Christopher Nelson added experimental AWS plugin.  AWS is the
	  experimental alternate window system, which aims to create a
	  lightweight window manager that doesn't take over the software,
	  supports definition files, and implements slots and signals.
	  This plugin has not been added to the global make.  It is still in
	  it's initial stages, but is committed so that people can look at
	  it.  Eric and I discussed a number of changes that we'd like to make
	  to csws, but they would require too much modification of the
	  existing code.  That would be both difficult, and would break a lot
	  of other peoples code.  All the existing CSWS components will be
	  "ported" over to the new code.
	  I would like to emphasize that this is completely experimental,
	  and is not meant to replace anything.  (yet.)
	- Norman Kramer fixed a bug in meta.cpp.
6-Jun-2001
	- Removed support for the quadtree, coverage mask tree, coverage mask
	  cube, and solid tree from CS. I parked the code locally and it will
	  also be in the CVS attic. Some of that code (especially the 3D
	  quadtree) will be useful to resurrect later but at this moment
	  it is just confusing me :-)
	- Added cs/iMovable::GetSectorCount() and also made a lot of the
	  functions 'const'.
	- Made a number of cs/iCamera members const.
	- Made a number of cs/iMeshWrapper members const.
	- Made a number of cs/iMeshFactoryWrapper members const.
	- Made a number of iVisibilityObject members const.
	- Made a number of iMeshObject members const.
	- Made a number of iMeshObjectFactory members const.
	- Added 'const' to a number of mesh object implementations and
	  state interfaces.
	- Added G3DRENDERSTATE_EDGES. This can be used by a 3D renderer
	  to enable edge drawing for debugging purposes.
	- OpenGL renderer implements this debugging feature (but software
	  doesn't right now).
	- Walktest will now enable edge drawing using this new functionality
	  instead of with callbacks. This means that with OpenGL the 'e'
	  command works again. Note that there is a difference compared
	  to the past. The 'e' command with OpenGL will now show the
	  resulting triangles that every polygon is triangulated too.
	- Eric Sunshine implemented iGraphics2D::SetMouseCursor() in the OpenGL
	  and Glide BeOS drivers.  (This method was already implemented in the
	  software driver.)
	- Michael Voasse did the following:
	    - Moved metaball to a mesh object.
	    - Added meta ball loader.
	    - Modified metasys to suit new meta ball.
	- Norman Kramer fixed ptlab to the new meta ball plugin.
	- Martin Geisse did the following:
	    - Removed DECLARE_TYPED_SCF_VECTOR(). This macro created a
  	      subclass of csVector that was intended to store SCF objects.
	      It was useless because it never did an IncRef() on the
	      contained objects, only a DecRef().
	    - Made iSoundWrapper a subclass of iBase.
	    - Completely rewrote csObject. It now stores a list of iObject
	      pointers and does not cast to csObject anymore. The reference
	      count of contained objects is correctly increased and
	      decreased. In addition, a csObject keeps a 'parent' pointer
	      that is set when an object is added or removed, but has no
	      further meaning and it is not IncRef'ed / DecRef'ed either. The
	      user can decide how to make use of this pointer.
	    - The remake of csObject required some changes in the whole of
	      CS. Mainly, where an object was added with ObjAdd (), a DecRef
	      to the added object had to be done. Calls to ObjRelease()
	      should be replaced by an IncRef() to the object-to-release and
	      then a RemoveObject, although there was no such case in the
	      current CS code.
	    - Removed csObjectNoDel and csPObject.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added visibility routine for terrfunc. The
	  computation in the quadtree.
	- Wouter also fixed a number of potential bugs in that code.
	  Fixed a warning, CS_ASSERT(a%b == 0) will give warnings,
	  CS_ASSERT(a%d) will put the %d in a printf even...
	- Martin Geisse fixed a compilation problem in the terrfunc plugin.
5-Jun-2001
	- Reduced the optimization level in linux.mak from -O6 to -O2.  This
	  will probably not do much anyway and -O6 seems to give problems with
	  gcc 2.96.  I hope -O2 works well enough.
	- Removed 'sndload' from 'make walkall'.
	- Norman Kramer made the Sound, VFS, G3D, G2D, MotionMan, Config and
	  NetDrv variables of csSystemDriver private.  If you want to access
	  the plugins represented by those variables first do a QUERY_PLUGIN to
	  get a pointer to them.  Also changed code in remainder of project to
	  accomodate this change.
	- Added a lot of 'const' qualifiers to many functions in csEngine and
	  iEngine.
	- Removed a few obsolete functions from iEngine having to do with
	  polygon texture planes.
	- Added 'const' to functions in csNamedObjVector.
	- Removed iSector::GetID().
	- Added iObject::GetID().
	- Added a lot of 'const' qualifiers to many functions in csSector and
	  iSector.
	- Fixed a warning in keyval.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed the isometric transform.  It has a LOT less
	  distortion now.  The cube is exactly 1x1x1 now, and you can see,
	  while changing the view that it stays in shape.
	- Wouter also added mesh factory convenience functions, and a list
	  of mesh factories is kept by the iso engine (by name).
	- Philip Wyett fixed MSVC project files which were committed as ASCII.
	- Avoids the bug with levels with multiple sectors and bsp trees.  The
	  level itself will now be rendered ok.  But the bug isn't gone for
	  real though.  Objects are still culled wrongly.
	- Started cleaning everything other than the c-buffer culler from CS
	  engine.  The rest isn't working either and is only useful for
	  reference (which CVS will hold).  This simplifies the engine
	  considerably.
	- Removed 'culler' command from WalkTest.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to SCF.
	    - Further optimized IncRef(), DecRef(), and QueryInterface() for
	      embedded interface.  No longer checks for non-null scfParent.
	      scfParent is now always assumed non-null for embedded interfaces.
	    - Added a new opaque type `scfInterfaceID' which represents a
	      registered SCF interface name.  This is used in place of the bare
	      `uint32' which represented registered names in the past.
	    - Added a bunch of new macros for providing finer control over the
	      implementation of the standard iBase methods.  These macros make
	      it easier to implement custom IncRef(), DecRef(), or
	      QueryInterface() calls while still providing automatic
	      implementations of functions which are not specially customized.
	      The new macros are:
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_INCREF()
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_DECREF()
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_QUERY()
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_QUERY_END
		IMPLEMENT_EMBEDDED_IBASE_INCREF()
		IMPLEMENT_EMBEDDED_IBASE_DECREF()
		IMPLEMENT_EMBEDDED_IBASE_QUERY()
		IMPLEMENT_EMBEDDED_IBASE_QUERY_END
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_INCREF()
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_DECREF()
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_QUERY()
		IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_QUERY_END
	      These macros are now employed by the higher-level convenience
	      macros IMPLEMENT_IBASE(), IMPLEMENT_IBASE_END,
	      IMPLEMENT_EMBEDDED_IBASE(), IMPLEMENT_EMBEDDED_IBASE_END,
	      IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT(), and IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_END.
	    - Changed the prototype for iSCF::QueryClassList() so that it no
	      longer returns the array of matching class names via a csVector.
	      It didn't seem correct for the SCF header file (scf.h) to rely on
	      a high-level class such as csVector considering that scf.h is
	      intended to be extremely bare-bones and low-level.  Now the array
	      of matching class names is returned as a (char const**).  Also
	      rewrote and simplified QueryClassList().
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a nasty problem on NextStep where
	  csMeshWrapper and csTerrainWrapper objects were not being removed
	  from their containing sector(s) when either of these objects was
	  deleted.  When a C++ object is destroyed, its destructor is invoked.
	  After the destructor completes, the object's `vptr' is modified to
	  point at the `vtbl' of its immediate superclass, and then the
	  destructor for that class is invoked.  This process repeats until the
	  destructors of all superclasses are invoked.  In this way, an object
	  transmogrifies into each of its superclasses until the raw memory for
	  the object is finally freed.  This transmogrification into an
	  object's superclass is supposed to occur _after_ the destructor for
	  the current class is finished.  Unfortunately, the NextStep compiler
	  performs the transmogrification immediately _before_ the destructor
	  for the current object is invoked.  This means that virtual methods
	  which are invoked in an object's destructor will actually invoke
	  methods from its superclass instead of correctly invoking its own
	  methods.  In the case of csMeshWrapper and csTerrainWrapper, their
	  destructors were invoking an engine method to remove themselves from
	  their occupied sectors, and those methods were invoking the virtual
	  QueryInterface(iMeshObject) method of each of these objects.
	  Unfortunately, since these objects had already been transmogrified
	  into their superclass (csPObject) by the time
	  QueryInterface(iMeshObject) was invoked, they were unable to respond
	  with an iMeshObject (since csPObject does not implement iMeshObject).
	  The failure to respond with an iMeshObject resulted in these objects
	  not being removed from the containing sectors, which later resulted
	  in a crash since the objects themselves had been deleted (thus the
	  sectors had dangling pointers to these objects).  To work around this
	  problem, it was necessary to invoke the code for removing the objects
	  from the sector(s) prior to destruction time.  This was accomplished
	  by writing a custom DecRef() method for each class and having that
	  method perform the removal.  Since these objects must now be detroyed
	  via DecRef() rather than via `delete', their destructors were also
	  made private.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from
	  portal.cpp.
	- Norman Kramer removed #ifdef DO_SOUND and replaced it with test
	  for soundrenderer being not NULL (blocks and walktest).
	- Justin Miller fixed some bugs in the OpenGL renderer with regards
	  to trying to cache textures for materials without them.
4-Jun-2001
	- Added csTransform This2OtherRelative() and Other2ThisRelative()
	  which operate on csPlane3.
	- Removed a couple of csIntersect3::Plane() routines to make things
	  simpler.
	- Did a little work on plane clipping in OpenGL renderer. It is
	  almost working perfectly now but there are still a few problems/bugs
	  here and there.
	- Fixed two bugs with csPolygon3D::IsTransparent() and polygons using
	  MIXMODE. When such a polygon was used on a portal the portal would
	  not detect that the polygon was transparent and the texture would
	  not be drawn.
	- Philip Wyett fixed output of OpenGL clipper detection by using
	  SysPrintf.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following to the iso engine:
	    - Fixed the transform for iso mesh objects. The current transform
	      causes MUCH less disforming than the previous. The secret to
	      this is by not translating 0,0,minz, but by  -minz*3/4,
	      -minz/4, +minz/4. Which is soooo obvious...
	    - Fixed potential mesh lighting problems.
	    - Adjusted the fountain to look nicer (a bit wider).
	- Christopher Nelson updated table code so that it works, with the
	  caveat that named tables are still not up. Changed all "char"
	  references to "unsigned char" in case someone needs the upper 128
	  characters of the UTF-8 or ASCII table in matching.  This is
	  primarily for international codepage support. 
	- Christopher Nelson also added final code for named table
	  recognition in the BuildTableLeaf function. Named tables (character
	  classes like alpha, alnum, space, upper, lower, print, graph,
	  cntrl, xdigit, digit) are now fully supported syntactic elements.
	- Martin Geisse did further work on the RTTI system:
	    - Added iDataObject as an interface for csDataObject.
	    - The above change makes it possible for walktest to use SCF
	      instead of RTTI.
	    - Rewrote csNodeIterator to use SCF instead of RTTI.
	- Martin Geisse removed the now unused 'old' RTTI system.
	- Norman Kramer did a lot of cleanup on CS with regards to querying
	  plugins (like iVFS, iGraphics3D, ...).
	- Norman split sound loaders into multiple plugins.
	- Norman added QueryClassList to scf.
	- Norman removed entries for soundloaders other than multiplex.
	  Removed imgplex.cfg. No longer needed. The image multiplexer now
	  uses QueryClassList.
	- Norman: the sound loader multiplexer now uses QueryClassList to
	  determine the list of sound loaders to use.
	- Eric Sunshine updated out-of-date Mingw comment in enginep.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefiles for map2cs, mdl2spr, scfreg,
	  scftutor, and gfxtest so that these applications successfully link on
	  NextStep in `debug' mode.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefile `clean' target so that it only
	  strips the trailing slash (/) from the $(OUTBASE) and $(OUTDLL)
	  variables rather than removing all slashes.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefile `install' target so that it now
	  takes the makefile variable $(OUTDLL) into account when installing
	  plugin modules.  Plugin modules are now installed into
	  $(INSTALL_DIR)/$(OUTDLL) when $(OUTDLL) exists, rather than
	  $(INSTALL_DIR)/lib.
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a very nasty problem where the `install'
	  target would try to build out-of-date or missing plugin modules using
	  the wrong commands!  It would try building these modules using with
	  the commands to build a static library.  This problem was caused by
	  the `install_all' target depending upon the generated plugin module
	  files.  Plugin modules must be built with the makefile variable
	  MAKE_DLL set to `yes', and unfortunately, by the time the
	  `install_all' target runs, it is already too late to set that
	  variable.  Furthermore, there is no way to individually set that
	  variable for each out-of-date or missing plugin module which must be
	  built.  There is no simple solution to the problem of MAKE_DLL=yes
	  not being set at the time that `install' runs, thus for now, I
	  modified the `install' target so that it no longer depends upon the
	  generated plugin module files.  It will still try to install all of
	  the plugin modules, but it will no longer automatically build
	  out-of-date or missing ones.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several problems with the new sound loader plugin
	  makefiles.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in imgplex.mak where it neglected to
	  install its imgplex.cfg configuration file.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in csws.mak where it neglected to install
	  its csws.cfg configuration file.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the Apple/NeXT ports so that they are now capable
	  of finding their plugin modules based upon the setting of the CRYSTAL
	  environment variable.
3-Jun-2001
	- Added new version of csFrustum::ClipToPlane() which accepts a
	  general plane instead of two vertices.
	- Renamed csPlane3::GetNormal() to Normal(). Also for csDPlane.
	- Martin Geisse added iDynLight::GetNext() and moved csObjectIt from
	  the old RTTI system to SCF.
	- Martin extended iCameraPosition and iEngine with functions from
	  csCameraPosition and csEngine. Levtool now uses the engine only
	  through interfaces.
	- Martin also added GetWarp() to iPortal and continued to change
	  levtool to use the engine through interfaces (seems like I
	  overlooked some cases last time :-)
	- Wouter Wijngaards extended iso engine so that you can now use mesh
	  objects in the iso engine. They are wrapped in a iIsoMeshSprite
	  class, and can be handled like any other iso Sprite. In the isotest
	  app you can see a fountain mesh, and a cube.
	- Wouter Wijngaards enabled lighting for mesh objects used in the
	  iso engine. Iso engine now exports a fake iLight interface.
	- Wouter fixed the perspectiveaspect, turned out to be a simple
	  mistake. The cube mesh now shows up at the correct spot - but looks
	  a bit weird due to uninited lighting.
	- Wouter added csgeom to the linex2d canvas, to fix csRect reference.
	- Philip Wyett started adding the new Direct Draw 8 plugin (not
	  Direct3D yet!).
	- Michael Voasse did some more work on motion manager.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a couple compilation warnings in isoview.cpp
	  regarding assignment of float to integer.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation errors from metasys.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the cslexan plugin:
	    - Renamed csrdparse.cpp and csrdparse.h to rdparse.cpp and
	      rdparse.h, respectively, for DOS 8.3 conformance.
	    - Added missing `#include "cssysdef.h"' to all .cpp files.
	    - Removed inclusion of cssysdef.h from ivaria/lexan.h.  (This file
	      should never be included by headers.)
	    - Now compiles with compilers which do not natively support the C++
	      `bool' type.
	- Eric Sunshine improved efed.pl so that it prints a meaningful error
	  message when the user specifies an invalid Perl regular-expression,
	  rather than printing some apparently unrelated error message about an
	  unknown function much later in the script.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed jpgio.mak and pngio.mak so that they work when
	  USE_PLUGINS=no is specified.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed vsh.mak and vfstest.mak so that these programs
	  can link when USE_PLUGINS=no.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefiles so that g2dtest, perftest, and
	  csdemo can link successfully when USE_PLUGINS=no.  These programs
	  required the CSGFX library.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a dormant bug in csCurveTemplate where it
	  incorrectly invoked DECLARE_IBASE_EXT() with an argument of csObject
	  rather than csPObject.
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a bizarre NextStep compiler bug where
	  calls to csBezierTemplate::QueryInterface() incorrectly invoked
	  csObject::QueryInterface() rather than correctly invoking
	  csCurveTemplate::QueryInterface().
2-Jun-2001
	- Fixed a very old bug in the OpenGL renderer. Triangle meshes as
	  seen through a mirror did make backface culling operate differently.
	  This resulted in the inside of the object being visible through
	  a mirror.
	- Fixed another bug in OpenGL clipper with regards to mirroring.
	- Martin Geisse changed the 'bumptest', 'demosky', 'metademo' and
	  'video' applications to use the engine only through SCF interfaces.
	- Philip Wyett removed the DirectX 6.1 plugin.
	- Wouter Wijngaards created a start for an iso mesh sprite.
	  Wraps around a mesh object, and that becomes a nice sprite in the
	  isometric engine. I've fudged the transformations now, so that the
	  perspective transformation will be almost like the isometric one,
	  for small objects (say for animated 3d sprites ;) ). It does not
	  work yet. The code is commented out in apps/isotest, with a #if. 
	- Christopher Nelson made some changes to the cslexan parser, added
	  most of the table support.  Still need to add character classes
	  (named tables) and finish the table build sequence.
	- Philip Wyett removed cslexan from build process until repaired.
	- Christopher Nelson writes:
	  Dumb me: I forgot that the make files automatically compile ALL
	  .cpp files in the source directory, not just specific ones.  I
	  hadn't intended csrdparse.cpp to be included in the build process
	  yet, but I also wanted to update the repository so that I could
	  work on it at home too.  I fixed the build problem, so cslexan
	  should compile normally again.  Sorry for the trouble Philip, and
	  thanks for letting me know. 
	- Philip Wyett added cslexan to build process.
1-Jun-2001
	- Martin Geisse changed the way in which csEngine represents a
	  csObject. It is no longer a subclass of csObject but instead has
	  a csObject as a member. More accurately, this member is not a
	  csObject but a subclass which overrides the SCF methods to serve
	  as an embedded interface. Also added an accessor method for it,
	  QueryCsObject().
	- Martin also optimized SCF in two cases:
	    - Normal (non-embedded) SCF objects increase and decrease the
	      reference count of their scfParent only once at construction
	      and destruction.
	    - Embedded interface have no longer a reference count because
	      it was not used anyway.
	- Christopher Nelson writes:
	  These are the new general RE parsing routines. They support
	  alternates, all wildcards, and have rudimentary support for
	  tables. Nesting alternates and wildcards is allowed.  Silly
	  syntax is ignored, and some syntactical errors are recovered from.
	  Forgetting ')', ']', or specifying an unknown named table are fatal.  
	- Philip Wyett fixed compiler warning in "Create2DSprites(void)"
	  caused by:
	    csEngine* engine = (csEngine*)engine;
	  when it should be:
	    csEngine* engine = (csEngine*)Engine;
	- Philip also modified video app to use iThingState and brought
	  into line with Jorrits changes.
	- Michael Voasse fixed a couple of additional bugs in motion
	  manager. Changed csAppliedFrameVector from TYPED_VECTOR to
	  TYPED_VECTOR_NODELETE. Note, motion manager now throws a compiler
	  warning, however it is due to the NODELETE typed vector. I could
	  fix csVector, but I would need to clear it with Jorrit first since
	  CS is HEAVILY dependent on csVector. If I break it, there will be a
	  lot of pieces to keep 8).
	- Michael Voasse did more bug stomping in motion manager. Removed
	  reverse flag, its now handled by setting a negative rate. Recoded
	  UpdateAppliedMotion() to actually *work*. Removed the total time
	  from ACTIONSET. Total time is now taken as the last frame time as
	  it was before. Added a frame count check to ApplyMotion. It will
	  not compile a frameset with less than two frames ( however, if
	  people want this feature please say so and I will add it... I
	  just dont think its necessary ).  Adjusted spr3dldr and walktest
	  to suit. I would consider motion manager now at beta and ready for
	  general testing and possible inclusion into RC 1.0 ( ie, I have
	  used and tested all available features ). SCF versions for
	  motion.h have been bumped to 0.9.x to indicate beta test phase.
  	  Note: You will need to do a recompile with depend to get spr3dldr
  	  and walktest going again.
	- Removed the old and obsolete iThing interface. Added
	  GetPrivateObject() to iThingState.
	- Extended iSector with functions to query/add/remove collections.
	- Extended iSector with GetNumLights() and GetLight().
	- Added iSector::HitBeam().
	- Added GetPrivateObject() to iCollection.
	- Added iEngine::GetNumMeshFactories() and GetMeshFactory().
	- Rationalized a bit of the engine API. Changed the following (replace
	  'Bla' in the following with whatever it is you are working on):
	    - csSector: GetNumberBla() to GetBlaCount()
	    - iSector: RemoveBla() to UnlinkBla()
	    - iSector: FindBla(char* name) to GetBla()
	- Changed csCameraPosition::Load() to work with iCamera and iEngine
	  instead of csCamera and csEngine.
	- Added iMeshWrapper::GetChildCount() and GetChild().
	- Added iMeshWrapper::GetRadius().
	- Reworked walktest so that it uses SCF interfaces more instead of
	  the direct classes. This avoids a lot of GetPrivateObject() calls.
	- Fixed all other apps to the changes above.
	- Removed the DDG landscape engine.
	- Fixed a bug in the landscape engine. If a light is after a triangle
	  it would actually subtract from the base color. Thanks to Wouter
	  Wijngaards for spotting this. This also improves speed of dynamic
	  lighting because there is no more need to clamp down.
	- Further improved walktest by removing references to csBla classes
	  and replacing them with iBla.
	- Added iMeshWrapper::GetScreenBoundingBox().
	- Added GetCollider() which works with iObject.
	- Added iSector::FollowSegment().
	- Eric Sunshine removed obsolete references to
	  crystalspace.string.server from several files.
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a NextStep compiler limitation where it
	  disallows C++ expressions in functions declared `extern "C"'.  This
	  problem was triggered by the SCF module_scfInitialize() function,
	  which is created by the EXPORT_CLASS_TABLE() macro, and which
	  contains the C++ expression `iSCF::SCF = SCF'.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the NextStep plugin generation process
	  (DO.SHARED.PLUGIN.POSTAMBLE in nextstep.mak) to take into account
	  the name change: module_GetClassTable() -> module_scfInitialize().
	  Also repaired the NextStep documentation in this regard.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem which prevented `simple' from
	  successfully linking on NextStep.  The problem was that the csparser
	  library still had dependencies upon csengine on NextStep.  The
	  problem was that the NextStep compiler has the peculiar behavior of
	  generating references to all symbols which are seen by it even if no
	  actual code refers to those symbols.  Thus, even unnecessarily
	  including a header file will result in dependencies upon the symbols
	  in the header.  In this case, impexp.cpp, which is part of csparser,
	  was unnecessarily including csengine/thing.h and csengine/meshobj.h.
	  Furthermore, csloader.h was unnecessarily including the obsolete
	  loadinfo.h header which contains forward references to a couple
	  csengine classes.  I also moved loadinfo.h to the CVS Attic since it
	  is no longer used.
	- Philip fixed some warnings in the python plugin.
	- Eric Sunshine disabled CS_EXTENSIVE_MEMDEBUG for the Apple/NeXT ports
	  since some of the Apple/NeXT compilers can't properly grok it.
	- Eric Sunshine modified the following classes to embed SCF interfaces
	  rather than inheriting them in order to work around multiple-
	  inheritance problems with the NextStep compiler:
	    iPolyTexFlat     -> csPolyTexFlat
	    iPolyTexGouraud  -> csPolyTexGouraud
	    iPolyTexLightMap -> csPolyTexLightMap
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a nasty bug in csEngine where a call to
	  QUERY_INTERFACE(engine,iObject) would fail even though csEngine
	  inherits from csObject which implements iObject.  For the technically
	  inclined, the problem was that csEngine was using DECLARE_IBASE and
	  IMPLEMENT_IBASE when it should have been using DECLARE_IBASE_EXT and
	  IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT.
