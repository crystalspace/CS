Here is a list of all people who have contributed to Crystal Space or gave important
tips. Some of these people are no longer active with CS and may not be reachable:<P>

<A HREF="mailto:jorrit.tyberghein@uz.kuleuven.ac.be">Jorrit Tyberghein</A> is the
main author of Crystal Space. He wrote the initial engine with the main current
functionality. He is still the main driving force after this project. Contact him
for any general and strategic question as well as specific implementation issues.
Jorrit's home address is Schoonstraat 11, 3020 Veltem Beisem, BELGIUM.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:demircio@boun.edu.tr">Murat Demircioglu</A> was the first
contributor for Crystal Space. He provided the first steps to porting Crystal
Space to DOS. Parts of his code is still present in the current version.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:derek_arnold@fuse.net">David N. Arnold</A> enhanced the DOS port made
by Murat. He added C++ classes and VESA support. David also wrote the original
Pentium assembler version of scan.cpp.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:noote@bigfoot.com">Nathaniel Saint Martin</A> is a very eager
Crystal Space fan :-) He even has his own Crystal Space dedicated
<A HREF="http://www.bigfoot.com/~noote/CrystalSpace" TARGET="_top">homepage</A>.
He enhanced Arnold's DOS port again so that it works with the Watcom C++ compiler.
He also suggested and implemented a considerable restructering of the
system-dependent stuff with every port having its own directory. He is also the
original author of the input/output console. Nathaniel was also the first to
actually present me with an almost working Windows 95 version WITH source! Nathaniel
is also responsible for most of the sound support code in Crystal Space. He made
the basic sound system, wrote the Windows drivers and wrote support for 3D sound.
Nathaniel created the config utility which allows for easier
editing of 'cryst.cfg'. Currently only for Windows and DOS. In addition he also
enhanced the (now non-existant) CSAR utility. He also helped develop the
Windows/Direct3D and Windows/OpenGL versions and is co-author of the Glide
port. His latest work has been some enhancements on the 3D sprites including two
convertors from Quake MDL and Quake II MD2 to Crystal Space (in contrib).<P>

<A HREF="mailto:jxsaarin@cc.helsinki.fi">Jyrki O Saarinen</A> made the original
Amiga port of Crystal Space. This old port can still be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.helsinki.fi/~jxsaarin/crystalspace/" TARGET="_top">Amiga port</A>
but it is very obsolete now.<p>

<A HREF="mailto:pfhorte@rogers.wave.ca">Steve Israelson</A> made the Macintosh
port of Crystal Space.  He also did some optimizations on the assembler
draw_scanline routines. Steve made the first preliminary physics system and also
implemented an easy uniform kind of dynamic lighting useful for fluorescent
lights and such. Steve greatly enhanced the routines to parse the world format.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:zorn@technologist.com">Bill Bohan</A> contributed the first
free textures for Crystal Space.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:lynx@tm.net.my">Ang See Chai</A> contributed another set of
textures.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:jaison@apk.net">Jaison Lee</A> gave me a new version of
police.fnt which doesn't give an error on the Borland compiler.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:filrv@syroxdev.co.uk">Phil Harvey</A> suggested a statistics
counter so that you can see the number of polygons considered and drawn each
frame. He helped with Nathaniel to get the Windows 32-bit port working. Phil
patched find_rgb_slow to make it slightly faster (but he forgot to rename it
to find_rgb_slow_somewhat_faster :-)<P>

<A HREF="mailto:d97ta@efd.lth.se">Tor Andersson</A> contributed some textures.
He also donated code for reading several file formats and a virtual machine.
This code has not been integrated with Crystal Space yet but you can find his
code in the 'contrib' directory. Tor  gave me a 'dj_joy.c' file (in the
'contrib' directory) which is an example on how to use the joystick from within
DOS with DJGPP. He also added JPG support to Crystal Space and support for the
mouse in DJGPP.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:alessandro.russo@ntt.it">Alessandro Russo</A> gave me a patch
for the X version of Crystal Space which allows simultanious keypresses and
disables autorepeat. This makes movement much more smoother. Alessandro Russo
presented me with a patch to fix the autorepeat problem (in X Windows).<P>

<A HREF="mailto:GaryC@jeld-wen.com">Gary Clark</A> designed the basic framework
of the Graphics3D class and I helped him start implement this. Gary also made
an extension so that Crystal Space can now use accurate RGB light sourcing.
Since this slows down the texture cache a bit I have made it optional (using
'cryst.cfg'). Also added a patch from Gary Clark to fix the problem with the
X version of CS that CS would not immediatelly start drawing but only after
an expose event was generated. He gave me the 'lin_joy.cpp' file (in the
'contrib' directory) which is an example on how to use the joystick from
within Linux.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:karlisf@cclu.lv">Karlis Freivalds</A> found and fixed a few
stupid bugs in wcc/watcom.cpp. I wonder how this version could work before he
fixed it :-)<P>

<A HREF="mailto:snapkus@iname.com">Darius Snapkauskas</A> was busy with 3D
sprites. He contributed some unfinished stubs for his work. Unfortunately
he seemed to have stopped supporting it. His code has now been moved to the
attic directory. The current 3D sprites in Crystal Space are developed by me
(Jorrit Tyberghein).<P>

<A HREF="mailto:dogles@peachtree.com">Dan Ogles</A> gave me a patch for 'printf'
so that it also works with the Windows port. Dan made the Direct3D port for
Windows! He greatly enhanced the Windows port and also added 16-bit support for
Windows. His greatest work up to now is converting the 3D and 2D graphics
subsystems to COM. He thus provided the foundations for the COM system (also on
non-Windows platforms) which Crystal Space was using in the past. He also
contributed the Halo code to Crystal Space.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:r.blum@advertainment.com">Robert Blum</A> patched Dan Ogles
'printf' patch so that there is no more buffer overrun and also found a bug in
'gifload.cpp'. He also ran a memory debugger on Crystal Space and found/fixed
many bugs related to that.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:anis@cyberus.ca">Anis Ahmad</A> updated the makefiles for
Watcom C++ for both Crystal Space and csar. He also made the Crystal Space
editor for Windows 95 which is unfortunatelly no longer supported.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:bit@eltech.ru">Andrew Zabolotny</A> ported Crystal Space to
OS/2. Andrew changed Crystal Space to read/write ZIP files instead of the
CSAR archive format. He enhanced Crystal Space to read PNG files. He did a
MAJOR MAJOR rewrite of the system dependent stuff and made a lot of support
classes for that. Andrew wrote the 2D sprites. Andrew wrote CSWS, the Crystal
Space Windowing System and is also busy writing MazeD, a Crystal Space level
editor. Andrew did very good work on DrawPolygon and DrawPolygonQuick. He also
rewrote the DJGPP port (non-Allegro) to use 16-bit and also support more
video modes. He recently ported almost all assembly to NASM and wrote a few
new routines. He also improved speed of fog and alpha transparency a lot. He
is also responsible for the current Makefile system. Andrew is also the
author of VFS (Virtual File System). His latest achievement is converting
the COM subsystem in CS to a new SCF system.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:jlilley@empathy.com">John Lilley</A> manages the Crystal Space
Texture Archive at <A HREF="http://www.empathy.com" TARGET="_top">Texture Archive</A>.<P>

helping maintaining the Amiga version.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:iavramov@ibm.net">Ivan Avramovic</A> cleaned all the matrix/vector
stuff and rewrote the Camera class. He also helped a lot with cleaning up the
perspective projection and clipping. He made some considerable improvements
there. He also helped me fix a lot of bugs with portals and clipping. Ivan also
enhanced the image loader classes to make it possible to dynamically add new
image formats even with a pre-compiled Crystal Space library. He also rewrote
the loader routines and added the csObject library which is now used in CS. He
also seperated the scripting stuff from the engine.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:Smirnov@bbs.math.spbu.ru">Slavik Levtchenko</A> created the
current Watcom port with 16-bit display support.<P>

the event system in CS and ported CS to Borland C++. He also found and fixed
some memory leaks. He also contributed the MemoryHeap class for the texture
cache. Olivier also ported the GCC assembler functions to Visual C++ and
implemented a few additional Visual C++ assembly functions. He also implemented
the BMP loader class. He also optimized and helped optimize several key-functions
in the engine pipeline. For example, he managed
to nearly DOUBLE the speed of the assembler scanline drawers!!!<P>

<A HREF="mailto:ddg@oz.net">Alex Pfaffe</A> integrated Crystal Space with
the VCOLLIDE library for collision detection. Later he removed VCOLLIDE and used
RAPID instead. He then rewrote RAPID to work better with Crystal Space. He
also contributed the ROAM landscape engine which is now integrated with CS.<P>

another this compiler doesn't support a C++ construction which other compilers
do support.<P>

<A HREF="mailto:ortalo@laas.fr">Rodolphe Ortalo</A> patched the Glide port so
that it works on Linux. He also send me output from Purify which helped a lot

source of suggestions and bug reports :-) Seth also updated the DOS/DJGPP
documentation and the tutorial. He also wrote the Squawk demo (using
the skybox). Seth also fixed the csCamera and csView classes so that the FOV
is no longer static and it is also possible to recenter each view
seperatelly. Seth added sprite vertex tweening and new lighting attenuation
settings.<P>
