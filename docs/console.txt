Console Commands
----------------

Pressing 'tab' activates the console. On the console there are several
commands that you can use to control how Crystal Space works. Several of
the commands are not directly useful for use from within the console
but they are attached to keys. There are several kinds of commands. Here
is a general explanation on how the commands work:

  - boolean commands. Boolean commands have either an 'on' or 'off' state.
    When you just type the command without arguments it will show you the
    current state of the command ('on' or 'off'). To turn the state on
    just use: 'on', 'yes', 'true', or '1' as the first argument of the
    command. To turn it off use: 'off', 'no', 'false', or '0'.
    To toggle a state use 'toggle'.
    Example:
	fps			-> show current setting for FPS display
    	fps on			-> enable FPS display
	fps 0			-> disable FPS display
	fps toggle		-> toggle FPS display

  - value commands. A value command has some value associated with it.
    Typing the command without arguments will show the current value.
    Just type the value after the command to change it. Using a '++'
    or '--' operator before the value will increase or decrease the value with
    the given amount.
    Example:
	gamma			-> show current gamma value
	gamma 1.5		-> set gamma to 1.5
	gamma ++0.05		-> increase gamma with 0.05
	gamma --0.05		-> decrease gamma with 0.05

  - multi-choice commands. A multi-choice command has one or more
    possible values. Typing the command without arguments will show the
    current value. Just type the new value after the command to change it.
    Use 'next' to switch to the next value and 'prev' to switch to the
    previous value.
    Example:
	lightmap		-> show the current lightmap setting
	lightmap reasonable	-> set lightmap setting to 'reasonable'
	lightmap next		-> use the next value for lightmap setting

  - general command. How the argument is interpreted depends on the
    command.

Here is a list of all commands:

Command: quit
Type:    general command
Action:  Quit Crystal Space (what did you expect :-)

Command: help
Type:    general command
Action:  Give a short list of all commands.

Command: colldet
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable new collision detection (using RAPID library).
         Corresponds to -colldet/-nocolldet commandline options.
	 COMMAND NOT USEFUL CURRENTLY.

Command: fclear
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable the clearing of the display every frame
	 (this is useful for debugging). Corresponds to -clear
	 command line option.

Command: debug
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable more debug information (which is written in
         debug.txt if the program crashes provided your system can
	 catch crashes).

Command: maxpol
Type:    value command
Action:  Set/get the maximum number of polygons that is drawn every
         frame. Normally this is set to a very high number so that this
	 maximum is never reached (2000000000 polygons every frame should
	 suit everones need for the near future :-)  You can reduce this
	 number for debugging purposes. In combination with 'fclear' and
	 binding a keys to 'maxpol ++1'  and 'maxpol --1' you can get the
	 effect of drawing one polygon at a time.

Command: stats
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable statistics display. Corresponds
	 to -stats/-nostats commandline options and STATS configuration
	 option.
	 Note that enabling the statistics counter automatically
	 disables the display of the coordinates.

Command: fps
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable FPS display (frames per second). Corresponds
	 to -fps/-nofps commandline options and FPS configuration
	 option.

Command: transp
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable transparent/filtered/alpha drawing.

Command: portals
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable drawing through portals. If this is off, a portal
	 will just draw as the default texture on the polygon.

Command: inter
Type:    multi-choice command
Action:  Choose the size of the interpolation step for simulation of
         perspective correct texture mapping. Default is 'smart' which
	 will base the selection on the slope of the polygon. This is the
	 fastest option but also the lowest quality as there are visible
	 pops when the slope of a polygon changes slightly and another
	 interpolation step is selected. Other choices are 'step8', 'step16',
	 and 'step32' which will set interpolation at 8, 16, or 32 steps
	 respectively.

Command: edges
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable display of edges around polygons. This is
	 useful for debugging.

Command: frustrum
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable the display of the view frustrum around the
         selected light (select lights with 'edges' enabled and by
	 clicking the left mousebutton on the light).

Command: texture
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable texture mapping.

Command: lighting
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable lighting.

Command: console
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Open/close console (is done automatically by 'tab' key).

Command: mipmap
Type:    multi-choice command
Action:  Selects when you want mipmapping. There are three possible
	 values: 'off', 'on', and 'always' (default is 'on').
	 When mipmapping is set to 'off' there will be no mipmapping.
	 When mipmapping is set to 'always' the highest level of
	 mipmapping is always selected (results in a blurred display).

Command: capture
Type:    general command
Action:  Make a screenshot in PCX format. This does not seem to work
	 correctly in all cases.

Command: cachedump

Command: coordsave
Type:    general command
Action:  Save the current position to the 'coord' file.

Command: coordload

	 the camera will only be restored if 'move3d' is set.

Command: coordshow
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable display of coordinate at runtime.
	 Note that enabling the coordinates display automatically
	 disables the statistics display.

Command: gamma

	 is neutral. 2.00 (for example) is lighter and 0.5 is
	 darker. Press 'g' or 'shf-g' to experiment with this value
	 at render time.
	 This command corresponds with the -gamma commandline option
	 and with the GAMMA configuration option.

Command: fov
Type:    value command
Action:  Control the FOV (Field Of Vision) of the display.
	 By default this is equal to the height (in pixels) of the
	 current display. Press 'f' or 'shf-f' to experiment with
	 this value at render time.
	 This command corresponds with the -fov commandline option
	 and with the FOV configuration option.

Command: dmipmap1
Type:    value command

	 get effect.
	 This command corresponds with the -dmipmap3 command option
	 and with the DMIPMAP3 configuration option.

Command: hi

Action:  Hilight the named polygon in the current sector. If the polygon
         is not found hilighting is disabled. This command is useful
	 for debugging.

Command: exec
Type:    general command
Action:  Start a script containing console commands. Every line in this
         script is performed one line at a time at every new frame.
	 The console automatically closes after executing a succesful
	 'exec' command.

Command: coordset
Type:    general command
Action:  Set the coordinate of the camera to the given sector and
         location. Example 'coordset room,0,0,0' to restore the

Command: about
Type:    general command
Action:  Write the current version to the console in a more
         verbose format.

Command: addlight
Type:    general command
Action:  Add a dynamic light at the position of the camera.
         With no arguments the color of this dynamic light will
	 be random and the light will move up and down slightly.
	 But you can also say 'addlight r,g,b,radius,st' for a more
	 controlled light. The 'st' flag can be 0 or 1. If 1 things
	 will also cast shadows.

Command: dellight

Command: droplight
Type:    general command
Action:  ...BROKEN...

Command: things
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle the display of things on/off (default on).

Command: ilace
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle interlace on/off (see config.txt for information about
         the INTERLACING option).

Command: mmx
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle MMX support on/off. This command corresponds with the
         MMX configuration file option (see config.txt for more info).
	 Note that this command is only useful if you have a MMX
	 capable processor.

Command: zbuf
Type:    boolean command
Action:  For debugging. When enabled this will show an alternate view
	 where far away objects are rendered in another color. In other
	 words: it tests the Z buffer. It works best in 16-bit mode.

Command: map
Type:    multi-choice command
Action:  Control the display of the map. 'off' (default) is off.
	 'overlay' shows the map on top of the current display.
	 'on' shows the map on its own. While the map is active,
	 moving with the arrow keys will move the map instead of
	 the display.

Command: texelflt
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Experimental feature. Disable/enable texel filtering (default
	 off). This will slow down the engine considerably and the
	 current implementation also shows artifacts.

Command: subcache
Type:    value command
Action:  Control the optimization of sub-textures in the cache. If 0
         this optimization will be disabled and textures will always be
         calculated completely. If any other size (power of two) then every
         texture will logically be split in sub-textures of the given size
         and only the visible sub-textures will be calculated (if needed).
         While this does not improve memory usage of the cache this optimization
         greatly improves the speed at which the cache is used and also make
         sure that the overhead of filling a texture is more equally spread
         accross several frames. Default value is 32.

Command: dyncache
type:    boolean command
Action:  If the sub-texture optimization is enabled (see the 'subcache' command)
         then this option controls if an additional optimization with dynamic
	 lighting is performed. With this optimization enabled (default) dynamic
	 lights will only cause recalculation of the sub-textures that were
	 really touched by the dynamic light.

Command: dblbuff
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable double buffering for systems that support this.

Command: fire
Type:    general command
Action:  Fire a missile in the direction that you are looking. The missile
         will explode when it hits a wall.

Command: debug0
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Debug command. The function of this command is undefined but it
         serves as a place-holder for some debugging functionality. A
	 particular version of Crystal Space may assign some action to this
	 command but another version may remove this action again.

Command: debug1
Type:    general command
Action:  Debug command. The function of this command is undefined but it
         serves as a place-holder for some debugging functionality. A
	 particular version of Crystal Space may assign some action to this
	 command but another version may remove this action again.

Command: debug2
Type:    general command
Action:  Debug command. The function of this command is undefined but it
         serves as a place-holder for some debugging functionality. A
	 particular version of Crystal Space may assign some action to this
	 command but another version may remove this action again.

Command: lm_grid
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable a lightmap grid which is overlayed on all lighted textures.
         This is for debugging and is disabled by default. You need to clear
	 the texture cache to see the effects of this command.

Command: lm_only
Type:    boolean command
Action:  When enabled texture mapping is disabled and lightmaps are drawn
         instead. You need to clear the texture cache to see the effects of
	 this command.

Command: cosfact
Type:    value command
Action:  Control the cosinus factor (default 0) used for lighting. See
         docs/config.txt for more details.

Command: p_alpha
Type:    value command
Action:  Change the alpha transparency for a selected portal. You can select
         a portal by clicking on it (only if it already has alpha transparency)
	 or else by using the 'hi' command. Legal values for p_alpha are
	 between 0 and 100.

Command: extension
Type:    general command
Action:  Perform the specified system specific extension. Currently the X11 port
         is the only port that has extensions (sim_pal, sim_grey, and sim_332). They
	 are used when simulating 15/16-bit display mode on a 8-bit display.

Command: bind
Type:    general command
Action:  Bind a key to a command. The given key can be anything like (alt-c,
         shift-pgdn, home, ctrl-space, ...). The command can be anything that
	 you can execute in the console. If you only give a key this command
	 will show the current command that is bound to that key. If you give
	 no parameters then all current key-bindings will be listed. Note that
	 if you bind a key which has already been bound then the old key-binding
	 will be removed.

Command: snd_play
Type:    general command
Action:  Play the given 'wav' file (currently only has effect on Windows) as an
         'ephemeral' wave.

Command: snd_volume

         current sector. Otherwise you can set the fog level for this sector.
	 Syntax is 's_fog r,g,b,density'.

Command: move3d
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle between between pure 3D movement (the old way) and
         'comfortable' movement (Quake-like). The latter is now default. This
	 basicly affects the left and right arrow keys which now rotate the
	 camera how you would expect it and also includes a gravity system.
	 When you enable 3D movement the gravity system is also disabled.

Command: do_gravity
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Enable/disable gravity (enabled by default).

Command: i_forward, i_backward, i_left, i_right, i_up, i_down
Type:    general command
Action:  Move. The first argument is 0 or 1. If 1 we will
         move VERY VERY slowly (for debugging). The second argument
	 is 0 or 1. If 1 we will move very fast. This command only
	 works if 'move3d' is enabled.

Command: i_rotleftc, i_rotleftw, i_rotrightc, i_rotrightw
Type:    general command
Action:  Rotate left or right. The 'c' versions rotate along the
         camera axis. The 'w' version along the world axis.
	 The first argument is 0 or 1. If 1 we will
         move VERY VERY slowly (for debugging). The second argument
	 is 0 or 1. If 1 we will move very fast. This command only
	 works if 'move3d' is enabled.

Command: i_rotleftx, i_rotleftz, i_rotrightx, i_rotrightz

	 is 0 or 1. If 1 we will move very fast. This command only
	 works if 'move3d' is enabled.

Command: freelook
Type:    boolean command
Action:  If freelook is enabled the mouse moves around like in Quake.
         By default freelook is disabled.

Command: addbot
Type:    general command
Action:  Add a sprite that moves randomly through the dungeon.

Command: delbot
Type:    general command
Action:  Remove the last added bot.

Command: loadsprite
Type:    general command
Action:  Load a sprite from a model file (currently 3DS version 3
         and MD2 are supported) and add it as a sprite template. Later
	 you can use 'addsprite' to really add the sprite visually.
	 Parameters are 'filename','templatename','texturename'. The
	 texture should be one which is already loaded in memory. This
	 is a current limitation.  The filename represents a file within
	 the VFS directory hierarchy.

Command: addsprite
Type:    general command
Action:  Add a sprite from a template already in memory.
	 'addsprite <name>,<size>'. <name> is the name of
	 a sprite template which needs to be loaded in memory (either
	 from standard.zip or from the level). The <size> is a scale
	 factor for the sprite. The sprite is put at the current
	 location.

Command: addskel
Type:    general command
Action:  Add a skeletal tree (demonstration). The first argument is the
	 depth. A depth of 1 will create a root and one layer above. The
	 second argument is the width. This is the number of branches
	 created at every depth. A good tree is 'addskel 3,3'. Be careful
	 with large numbers here. The number of triangles grows VERY fast!
	 If the width parameter is negative the choosen width will be
	 random between 1 and -width (inclusive).

Command: addghost
Type:    general command
Action:  Add a floating transparent green ghost. The first argument is the
	 depth. A depth of 1 will create a root and one layer above. The
	 second argument is the width. This is the number of arms for
	 the ghost.

Command: gouraud
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle support for gouraud shading. By default this is on.

Command: dumpvis
Type:    general command
Action:  This command takes the current view and dumps information for the
         rendering process. You will see what sectors and polygons are
	 rendered and how they are clipped. This is useful for debugging
	 purposes. The output comes into 'debug.txt'.

Command: cbuffer
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle c-buffer rendering on/off. In some levels (especially levels
         with many non-moving things) enabling the c-buffer for the engine can
	 improve performance considerably. By default it is off (currently).
	 Note that the level needs to be prepared for this (octree needs
	 to be added using STATBSP command). Enabling the c-buffer
	 disables the quadtree and coverage mask tree automatically.

Command: quadtree
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle quadtree rendering on/off. In some levels (especially levels
         with many non-moving things) enabling the quadtree for the engine can
	 improve performance considerably. By default it is off (currently).
	 Note that the level needs to be prepared for this (octree needs
	 to be added using STATBSP command). Enabling the quadtree
	 disables the c-buffer and coverage mask tree automatically.

Command: covtree
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Toggle coverage mask tree rendering on/off. In some levels
         (especially levels with many non-moving things) enabling the
	 coverage mask tree for the engine can
	 improve performance considerably. By default it is off (currently).
	 Note that the level needs to be prepared for this (octree needs
	 to be added using STATBSP command). Enabling the coverage mask
	 tree disables the c-buffer and quadtree automatically.

Command: lod
Type:    value command
Action:  Change the global LOD setting for sprite. 1 is full detail, 0 is
         no detail at all (i.e. you will not see the sprite). -1 is disabled.
	 Any value between 0 and 1 is legal. Default is 1.

Command: sprlight
Type:    boolean command
Action:  Change quality setting of sprite lighting. If yes every vertex will
         be lit according to the correct distance with the light. If no then
	 the distances for all vertices are calculated to the center of the
	 sprite. Default is ´no'. This option can also be set with the
	 SPRITE_HIGHQUAL option in the config file.

Command: clrlights
Type:    general command
Action:  Clear all pseudo-dynamic lights in the world to black.

Command: setlight
Type:    general command
