http://www.crystalspace3d.org/

Crystal Space is a free, open source, portable, modular, and extensible 3D
software development kit (SDK) written in C++. It is suitable for creation of
3D games and other 3D visualization applications.  It supports true six degrees
of freedom, colored lighting, lightmapped and stencil based lighting, shader
support (CG, vertex programs, fragment programs, etc.), mipmapping, portals,
mirrors, alpha transparency, reflective surfaces, 3D sprites with skeletal
animation, procedural textures, particle systems, volumetric fog, hierarchical
transformations, physics, bindings for Java, Perl, and Python, and many
additional features.  Crystal Space runs on Microsoft Windows, MacOS/X, and
Unix platforms (including GNU/Linux, BSD, Darwin, etc.).
