#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The msvcgen process needs to be presented with configuration information
# suitable for Windows regardless of which platform is actually invoking
# msvcgen.  This information comes from the static CS/mk/msvcgen/config.jam
# file.  It controls which modules will be seen by msvcgen, and provides
# additional compiler and linker flags when appropriate.
#
# On the other hand, local tools, such as Perl, are required for the actual
# invocation of msvcgen, thus we need to use our own local configuration,
# $(BUILDTOP)/Jamconfig; yet this configuration may cause the wrong set of
# progjects to be built if it is specific to a platform other than Windows.
# For instance, on MacOS/X, a local Jamconfig will cause msvcgen to generate a
# project file for the CoreAudio plugin, which is specific to Macintosh.
#
# To work around this problem, we compose a special-purpose Jamconfig.msvcgen,
# which is a combination of CS/mk/msvcgen/config.jam and the module-agnostic
# information from $(BUILDTOP)/Jamconfig; that is, we extract information about
# local tools, such as Perl, but omit information about modules relevant to the
# local platform, such as CoreAudio.  The resulting Jamconfig.msvcgen is
# essentially a cross-building configuration, suitable for generating project
# files for Windows from the local platform (which might not be Windows).  We
# create Jamconfig.msvcgen only when needed by making it a dependency of the
# top-level msvcgen targets, and we instruct Jamrules to utilize this custom
# configuration file by overriding JAMCONFIG.

## MsvcJamconfig customconfig : jamconfig : jamconfigdir : boilerplate :
##     boilerplatedir [ : rejects ]
##   Create a hybrid Jam configuration file (as discussed above) by combining
##   the 'boilerplate' file (which should contain MSVC-specific configuration)
##   with a filtered version of this platform's Jamconfig file, 'jamconfig'
##   (which resides in 'jamconfigdir').  The generated hybrid configuration
##   file, 'customconfig' will be placed in 'jamconfigdir'.  'rejects' is a
##   list of grep-style expressions which will filter out unwanted content from
##   'jamconfig', leaving only the content which is required for actually
##   running msvcgen.  (These are not extended grep-style patterns.  If you
##   need those, then you will also need to redefine $(GREP) as "egrep" or
##   "grep -E", if supported by the platform.)  'customconfig' will be made a
##   dependency of each of the 'msvcgen' targets to ensure that it is created
##   in time for th actual project synthesis run; and will be cleaned by
##   'msvcclean', 'clean', and 'distclean'.
